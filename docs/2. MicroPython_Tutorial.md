## 2-2 IoT Projects

The ESP32 iot Learning Kit utilizes the ESP32-S3 WiFi and Bluetooth to support a variety enjoyable IoT projects. Here we provide a tutorial to do these projects.

WiFi connectivity allows you to connect the Arduino to the Internet and cloud platforms. With WiFi, you can build projects like simple Web servers to remotely control leds, or Arduino IoT Cloud interactions to monitor sensors. 

As for Bluetooth, it supports localized(short-range) wireless communication, including Bluetooth control LED, relay, RGB and buzzer. We pair the ESP32 with your smartphone or other Bluetooth-enabled device to perform a variety of control and monitoring tasks.

---

### 2-2-01 IoT Bluetooth Control LED

---

**1. Overview**

In this experiment, we develop a simple Bluetooth Low Power (BLE) serial communication application with an ESP32 microcontroller. The ESP32 integrates Wi-Fi and Bluetooth, making it ideal for developing wireless applications. BLE is a low power wireless communication protocol designed for short distance communication. 

Here’s how to set up an ESP32 as a BLE server and communicate with BLE clients over a serial connection. We also add LED configuration and custom commands such as “1” and “0”. These commands allow you to control the on and off of the LED by sending commands from **LightBlue** APP on your mobile device.

---

**2. Component Knowledge**

**(1) ESP32 Bluetooth**

The ESP32 WROOM 32 integrates Wi-Fi and Bluetooth. It supports Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) and Classic Bluetooth protocols and can be used as a Bluetooth client or server. As a Bluetooth client, it can connect to other Bluetooth devices and exchange data with them. As a Bluetooth server it provides services to other devices.

The module supports several Bluetooth profiles, including Generic Access Profile (GAP), Generic Attribute Profile (GATT), and Serial Port Profile (SPP). The SPP allows the module to emulate a serial port over Bluetooth, enabling serial communication with other Bluetooth devices.

When using the Bluetooth of the ESP32 WROOM 32, we need to program with an appropriate software development kit (SDK) or an Arduino IDE with the ESP32 BLE library that provides advanced interfaces for BLE, including an example of how to use the module as a BLE client and server.

Bluetooth is a short-distance communication system that can be divided into two types, namely Low Power Bluetooth (BLE) and classic bluetooth. There are two modes for simple data transfer: master mode and slave mode.

**Master Mode**: In this mode, work is done on the master device and can be connected to the slave device. When the device initiates a connection request in the main mode, information such as the address and pairing password of other bluetooth devices are required. Once paired, you can connect directly to them.

**Slave Mode**: A bluetooth module in the slave mode can only accept connection requests from the host, but cannot initiate connection requests. After being connected to a host device, it can send and receive data through the host device . Bluetooth devices can interact with each other, when they interact, the bluetooth device in the main mode searches for nearby devices. While a connection is established, they can exchange data. For example, when a mobile phone exchanges data with ESP32, the mobile phone is usually in master mode and the ESP32 is in slave mode.

![Img](./media/img-20241129132930.png)

Overall, the Bluetooth capability of the ESP32 WROOM 32 provides a convenient and low-power way to enable wireless communication in the project.

**(2) LED**

![Img](./media/img-20230213165550.png)

An LED is a semiconductor known as a "light-emitting diode", which is made of semiconductor materials (silicon, selenium, germanium, etc.). It is polar. The short pin is negative that connects to GND, while the long one is positive that connects to 3.3V or 5V.

![Img](./media/img-20230213165602.png)

- Here is the detailed introduction for the LED: [LED - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light-emitting_diode)

**(3) Five-color-ring Resistor**

A resistor limits or regulates the flow of current in the circuit. The left picture is the appearance of the resistor and the right one is its circuit symbol. Its unit of R is ohm(Ω). 1 MΩ= 1000 kΩ, 1 kΩ = 1000Ω.

![Img](./media/img-20230213165612.png)

We can use resistors to protect sensitive components, like LED. The resistance(Ω) is marked on the body with an electronic color code. Each color represents a number, and you can refer to it in the resistance card.

-ring 1 – 1st Digit.
-ring 2 – 2nd Digit.
-ring 3 – 3rd Digit.
-ring 4 – Multiplier.
-ring 5 – Tolerance.

![Img](./media/img-20230213165620.png)

In this kit, we provide four five-color-ring resistor. Here we take three of them as examples.

220Ω resistor *10

![Img](./media/img-20230213165647.png)

10KΩ resistor *10

![Img](./media/img-20230213165705.png)

1KΩ resistor *10

![Img](./media/img-20230213165715.png)

- You can learn more about resistor from Wiki: [Resistor - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resistor)

In the same voltage, there will be less current but more resistance. The connection between current(I), voltage(V), and resistance(R) can be expressed: I=U/R. In the figure below, for instance, if the voltage is 3V, the current through R1 equals I = U / R = 3 V / 10 KΩ= 0.0003A= 0.3mA.

![Img](./media/img-20230213165731.png)

- You can learn more about Ohm’s Law from Wiki: [Ohm’s Law - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ohm%27s_law)

Don’t connect a low resistance directly to the two poles of the power supply, as this will cause excessive current to damage the electronic components. Resistors are nonpolar.

**(4) Breadboard**

Breadboards are used to build and test circuits quickly before completing any circuit design. There are many holes in the breadboard so that components such as resistors can be inserted into it. 
A typical breadboard is shown below:

![Img](./media/img-20230213165744.png)

The breadboard comes with many metal strips that run underneath the board to connect holes together. They are laid out as shown below. Note that the top and bottom rows of holes are connected horizontally, while the remaining holes are connected vertically.

![Img](./media/img-20230213165753.png)

The first two rows (top) and the last two rows (bottom) are used for power positive(+) and negative(-) respectively. The conductive layout is shown below:

![Img](./media/img-20230213165803.png)

We should know that the up and low holes of groove in the middle are not connected. So we can connect the DIP(Dual in-line Packages) components (say, integrated circuits, microcontrollers, chips, etc.) as shown below:

![Img](./media/img-20230213165816.png)

![Img](./media/img-20230213165822.png)

**9. Code Explanation**

- **Include libraries**: Libraries, including asyncio, aioble, randint, random, and bluetooth, should be imported before connecting the ESP32 board to Bluetooth.

```python
from micropython import const
import asyncio
import aioble
import bluetooth
import struct
from machine import Pin
from random import randint
```
- **Define UUID and register GATT services and characteristics**: Define the UUID of the service and its characteristics, one will hold the LED value and the other will hold the assumed sensor reading (it is recommended to use the same UUID we are using); Then, register GATT services and characteristics.

```python
_BLE_SERVICE_UUID = bluetooth.UUID('19b10000-e8f2-537e-4f6c-d104768a1214')
_BLE_SENSOR_CHAR_UUID = bluetooth.UUID('19b10001-e8f2-537e-4f6c-d104768a1214')
_BLE_LED_UUID = bluetooth.UUID('19b10002-e8f2-537e-4f6c-d104768a1214')
# How frequently to send advertising beacons.
_ADV_INTERVAL_MS = 250_000

# Register GATT server, the service and characteristics
ble_service = aioble.Service(_BLE_SERVICE_UUID)
sensor_characteristic = aioble.Characteristic(ble_service, _BLE_SENSOR_CHAR_UUID, read=True, notify=True)
led_characteristic = aioble.Characteristic(ble_service, _BLE_LED_UUID, read=True, write=True, notify=True, capture=True)

# Register service(s)
aioble.register_services(ble_service)
```
- **Encode and decode data**: The data to write characteristics needs to be in a specific format. `_encode_data()` converts the data to UTF-8 format.

```python
def _encode_data(data):
    return str(data).encode('utf-8')
```
- When other devices write `led_characteristic` , the data will be in byte format. The following function converts bytes to integers.

```python
def _decode_data(data):
    try:
        if data is not None:
            # Decode the UTF-8 data
            number = int.from_bytes(data, 'big')
            return number
    except Exception as e:
        print("Error decoding temperature:", e)
        return None
```
- **Get new values and write characteristics**: `sensor_task()` is an asynchronous function that gets a new random value. It performs a write characteristic to the `sensor_characteristic` through `write()`. This task is repeated once per second. You can adjust the delay time as needed.

```python
async def sensor_task():
    while True:
        value = get_random_value()
        sensor_characteristic.write(_encode_data(value), send_update=True)
        #print('New random value written: ', value)
        await asyncio.sleep_ms(1000)
```
When using `get_random_value()`, we should replace it with a function that will get the sensor data, for example, the temperature from the DS18B20 temperature sensor.

- **Annunciation**: In addition to writing the sensor characteristics, we also need to announce the ESP32 as a BLE service. So we use `peripheral_task()`.

```python
async def peripheral_task():
    while True:
        try:
            async with await aioble.advertise(
                _ADV_INTERVAL_MS,
                name="ESP32_Bluetooth",
                services=[_BLE_SERVICE_UUID],
                ) as connection:
                    print("Connection from", connection.device)
                    await connection.disconnected()             
        except asyncio.CancelledError:
            # Catch the CancelledError
            print("Peripheral task cancelled")
        except Exception as e:
            print("Error in peripheral_task:", e)
        finally:
            # Ensure the loop continues to the next iteration
            await asyncio.sleep_ms(100)
```

**Attention please,** In this function, we define the BLE device name to “ESP32_Bluetooth”. You can rename it if you want. However, if you want to follow our example, we recommend that you keep the name.

- **Wait to write**:  `wait_for_write()` keeps checking whether the `led_characteristic` is written. When it is activated, we decode the data and turn the ESP32 on-board LED on or off accordingly.

```python
async def wait_for_write():
    while True:
        try:
            connection, data = await led_characteristic.written()
            print(data)
            print(type)
            data = _decode_data(data)
            print('Connection: ', connection)
            print('Data: ', data)
            if data == 1:
                print('Turning LED ON')
                led.value(1)
            elif data == 0:
                print('Turning LED OFF')
                led.value(0)
            else:
                print('Unknown command')
        except asyncio.CancelledError:
            # Catch the CancelledError
            print("Peripheral task cancelled")
        except Exception as e:
            print("Error in peripheral_task:", e)
        finally:
            # Ensure the loop continues to the next iteration
            await asyncio.sleep_ms(100)
```
- **Main function**: We create an asynchronous `main()` function, in which the basis of the code will be written. We create three asynchronous tasks: one for announcements, one for writing sensor characteristics, and one for controlling LED when writing `led_characteristic` on other devices.
```python
async def main():
    t1 = asyncio.create_task(sensor_task())
    t2 = asyncio.create_task(peripheral_task())
    t3 = asyncio.create_task(wait_for_write())
    await asyncio.gather(t1, t2)
```
Finally, run the code as follows.
```python
asyncio.run(main())
```

### 2-2-02 IoT Bluetooth Control Buzzer

---

**1. Overview**

In previous experiments, we have learned how Bluetooth transmits data and controls LED. Here we  configure buzzer to set custom commands such as “1” and “0”. These commands allow you to control the buzzer to emit sound by sending commands from **LightBlue** APP on your mobile device.

---

**2. Component Knowledge**

**Active buzzer**

![Img](./media/img-20240826084218.png)

In the active buzzer, a simple oscillator circuit is integrated to convert constant direct current into pulse signals with a certain frequency. Once it receives a high level, it will emit sound. 

However, passive buzzer is without vibration source, so it must be driven by 2k ~ 5k square waves, rather than a DC signal. 

They are very similar in appearance, but the passive one buzzer is with a green circuit board, while the active one is with black tape. Passive buzzers are not polar, yet active ones are. 

![Img](./media/img-20240826084416.png)

- You can learn more about buzzer from Wiki: [Buzzer - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buzzer)

**Transistor**

As buzzer requires large current but GPIO of ESP32 output capability cannot meet this requirement, a NPN transistor is needed to amplify the current. 

![Img](./media/img-20240826090124.png)

Transistor is a semiconductor that controls current. It amplifies weak signals or works as a non-contact switch. 

According to structures, it can be divided into NPN and PNP. Both of them comes with three electrodes: base(B), collector(C) and emitter(E). The PN junction between E and B is also named “emitting junction”, and that between C and B is also called “collecting junction”. 

- You can learn more about transistor from Wiki: [P-N junction - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P%E2%80%93n_junction)

As shown below, the arrow points to the direction of current flow.

![Img](./media/img-20240913130716.png)

![Img](./media/img-20240913133904.png)

When there is current passing between “BE”, “CE” will allow several-folded current pass (amplified by the transistor). At this point, transistor works in the amplifying area. When current between “BE” exceeds a certain value, “CE” will not allow current to increase any longer. Now the transistor works in the saturation area.

Here are the two types of transistor: PNP and NPN

![Img](./media/img-20240826084842.png)

***In this kit, we mark PNP transistor as 8550, and NPN as 8050.***

It is often used as a switch in digital circuits. As microcontroller's capacity to output current is very weak, transistor is a perfect choice to amplify current and drive large-current components. 

NPN transistor drives buzzer: If GPIO outputs high, current will flow through R1, the transistor will get conducted, and the buzzer will emit sound. If GPIO outputs low, no current flows through R1, so the transistor will not be conducted to enable buzzer to sound. 

PNP transistor drives buzzer: If GPIO outputs low, current will flow through R1, the transistor will get conducted, and the buzzer will emit sound. If GPIO outputs high, no current flows through R1, so the transistor will not be conducted to enable buzzer to sound.

### 2-2-03 IoT Bluetooth Control Relay

---

**1. Overview**

In daily life, we generally use 220V AC to drive electrical appliances and control them with switches. However, if the switch is directly connected to the 220V AC circuit, once leakage occurs and people will be in danger. 

Therefore, in this project, we specially designed this relay module with NO(normally open) and NC(normally closed) to work with wireless data transmission of Bluetooth.

### 2-2-04 IoT ESP32 WiFi Station Mode

---

**1. Overview**

One of the most useful features of the ESP32 is that it can not only act as a Web server, but also to create its own network for other devices to connect to and access web pages. ESP32 can run in three modes: Station (STA) mode, Soft Access Point (AP) mode, and Station+AP mode.

- Station mode: Actively connect to the router as a WiFi device, also known as WiFi Client
- AP mode: As an Access Point for other WiFi devices to connect to, i.e., WiFi hotspots
- Station+AP mode: While the ESP32 connects to the router, it is also a hotspot for other WiFi devices to connect to.

All WiFi programming projects must be configured with WiFi running mode before using, otherwise the WiFi cannot be used. In this project, we are going to learn the ESP32 WiFi Station Mode.

---

**2. Component Knowledge**

**Station Mode**

In Station mode, the ESP32 connects to an existing WiFi network (a network created by a wireless router).

When setting Station mode, the ESP32 is taken as a WiFi client. It can connect to the router network and communicate with other devices on the router via a WiFi connection. As shown in the figure below, the PC and the mobile device have been connected to the router. If the ESP32 wants to communicate with the PC and the mobile device, they need to be connected to the router.

![Img](./media/img-20241205195730.png)

In Station mode, the ESP32 gets its IP address from the wireless router it is connected to. With this IP address, it can set up a Web server and serve web pages to all connected devices on an existing WiFi network.

### 2-2-05 IoT Control LED Via Web server

---

**1. Overview**

In this project, we will learn to remotely control leds by a Web server and browser on a computer or smartphone. Specifically, the ESP32 will be programmed to work as a Web server. Assume that the lP address of the ESP32 is 192.168.XX.XX. Here’s how it works.

When you access 192.168.XX.XX in your browser, it sends a request to the ESP32 to respond to a web page with an on/off button to control the LED.

Click “ON” in your web pages or input “192.168.XX.XX/?1ed=on” in the browser, the LED turns on and the ESP32 responds to the control page.

Click “OFF” in your web pages or input “192.168.XX.XX/?1ed=off” in the browser, the LED turns off and the ESP32 responds to the control page.

**6. Code Explanation**

Let’s explain the code in details:

- Create a web server using sockets and the Python socket API. For how to import `socket` library:

```python
try:
  import usocket as socket
except:
  import socket
```
- You need to import the `Pin` class from the `machine` module to interact with GPIO.

```python
from machine import Pin
```
- After importing the `socket`, we need to import `network` that allows us to connect the ESP32 to a Wi-Fi network.

```python
import network
```
- Disable the operating system debugging information and run the garbage collector.

```python
import esp
esp.osdebug(None)

import gc
gc.collect()
```
- Set the network credentials variable, set the ESP32 as a Wi-Fi station, and then activate the workstation, where the ESP32 connects to the router using the SSID and password defined earlier.

```python
ssid = 'REPLACE_WITH_YOUR_SSID'         # Enter router name
password = 'REPLACE_WITH_YOUR_PASSWORD'  # Enter router password

station = network.WLAN(network.STA_IF)

station.active(True)
station.connect(ssid, password)
```
- The following statement ensures that the code does not continue to execute when ESP is not connected to your network.

```python
while station.isconnected() == False:
  pass
```
- After the connection is successful, print the network interface parameters, such as the IP address of the ESP32, and use the `ifconfig()` object on the `station`.

```python
print('Connection successful')
print(station.ifconfig())
```
- Create a `Pin` called `led`,  which is an output, referring to the ESP32’s GPIO26.

```python
led = Pin(26, Pin.OUT)
```
- First create a function called `web_page()` which returns a variable named `html` that contains the HTML text used to build the web page.

```python
def web_page():
```
- The page displays the current GPIO status. Therefore, before generating the HTML text, we need to check the LED status. We save its state on the `gpio_state` .

```python
if led.value() == 1:
  gpio_state="ON"
else:
  gpio_state="OFF"
```
The `gpio_state` is then concatenated to the HTML text with a “+” sign to concatenate the string.

```python
html = """<html><head> <title>ESP Web Server</title> <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">

```
- Create a socket using `socket.socket()` and specify the socket type. We create a new socket object `s` with the given address family and socket type. This is a new STREAM TCP socket.

```python
s = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
```
- bind the socket to an address (network interface and port number) by `bind()` that accepts a tuple variable with an ip address and a port number.

```python
s.bind(('', 80))
```
In our example, we pass an empty string '' as the IP address and port 80. In this case, the empty string refers to the IP address of the local host (that is, the IP address of the ESP32).

- The next line allows the server to accept connections by creating a “listening” socket. Specify the maximum number of parameters for queued connections. The maximum number is 5.

```python
s.listen(5)
```
- In `while` , we listen for requests and send responses. When the client connects, the server calls `accept()` to accept the connection, and it stores a new socket object on the `conn` to receive and send data, and stores the address of the client connecting to the server on `addr` .

```python
conn, addr = s.accept()
```
-  Print the client address saved on the `addr` .

```python
print('Got a connection from %s' % str(addr))
```
- Get the request received on the newly created socket and save it in the request variable.

```python
request = conn.recv(1024)
```
The `recv()` receives data from the socket client (we have created a new socket object on `conn` ), and the parameter of `recv()` specifies the maximum data that can be received at one time.

- Print the content of the request.

```python
print('Content = %s' % str(request))
```
- Create a variable called `response` containing the HTML text returned by `web_page()`.

```python
response = web_page()
```
- The response is sent to the socket client by `Send()` and `sendall()` .

```python
conn.send('HTTP/1.1 200 OK\n')
conn.send('Content-Type: text/html\n')
conn.send('Connection: close\n\n')
conn.sendall(response)
```
- Close the created socket.

```python
conn.close()
```

### 2-2-06 IoT Control Relay Via Web server

---

**1. Overview**

In this project, we will learn to remotely control the relay by a Web server and browser on a computer or smartphone. Specifically, the ESP32 will be programmed to work as a Web server. Assume that the lP address of the ESP32 is 192.168.XX.XX. Here’s how it works.

When you access 192.168.XX.XX in your browser, it sends a request to the ESP32 to respond to a web page with an on/off button to control the LED.

Click “ON” in your web pages or input “192.168.XX.XX/?relay=on” in the browser, the relay turns on and the ESP32 responds to the control page.

Click “OFF” in your web pages or input “192.168.XX.XX/?relay=off” in the browser, the relay turns off and the ESP32 responds to the control page.

**7. Code Explanation**

Let’s explain the code in details:

- Add your network name and password.

```python
ssid = 'REPLACE_WITH_YOUR_SSID'
password = 'REPLACE_WITH_YOUR_PASSWORD'
```
- **Connect to Wi-Fi**: Create a sub-function `connect_wifi()` to connect to a Wi-Fi network.

```python
def connect_wifi():
    wlan = network.WLAN(network.STA_IF)
    wlan.active(True)
    wlan.connect(ssid, password)
    while not wlan.isconnected():
        print('Connecting to WiFi...')
        time.sleep(1)
    print('WiFi connected:', wlan.ifconfig())

# Connect to Wi-Fi
connect_wifi()
```
- **Set ADC pin**: adc = machine.ADC(machine.Pin(36)) is used to configure ADC pins; adc.atten(machine.ADC.ATTN_11DB) sets the attenuation factor; and adc.width(ADC.WIDTH_12BIT) sets the ADC width.

```python
adc = machine.ADC(machine.Pin(36))
adc.atten(machine.ADC.ATTN_11DB)  
adc.width(ADC.WIDTH_12BIT)
```
- **Read temperature**: `read_temperature()` reads the ADC value and converts it to temperature.

```python
def read_temperature():
    raw_value = adc.read()
    voltage = raw_value / 4095 * 5.0
    temperature = voltage / 0.01  # The LM35 output is 0.01V/°C
    return temperature
```
- **Create a Web page**: `web_page()` generates an HTML page containing temperature values.

```python
def web_page():
  temperature = read_temperature()
  html = """<!DOCTYPE HTML><html><head>
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://use.fontawesome.com/releases/v5.7.2/css/all.css" integrity="sha384-fnmOCqbTlWIlj8LyTjo7mOUStjsKC4pOpQbqyi7RrhN7udi9RwhKkMHpvLbHG9Sr" crossorigin="anonymous">

    .ds-labels{ font-size: 1.5rem; vertical-align:middle; padding-bottom: 15px; }
  </style></head><body><h2>ESP with LM35</h2>
  <p>
    <i class="fas fa-thermometer-half" style="color:#059e8a;"></i> 
    <span class="lm-labels">Temperature</span>

    <sup class="units">&deg;F</sup>
  </p></body></html>"""
  return html
```
- **Create a Web Server**: Create a simple Web server with the socket library that listens on port 80 and returns temperature values when a request is received

```python
s = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
s.bind(('', 80))
s.listen(5)
```

**1. Overview**

Have you ever wished you could monitor the temperature and humidity in your home, cooler or wine cellar at all times by your smartphone, tablet, or computer? This IoT project might be a good place to start!

We use the ESP32 as the control device to connect to the existing WiFi network and create a Web server. When the device is connected to this server, the ESP32 will read the temperature and relative humidity from the DHT11 sensor and send it to browser of the mobile device.

**6. Code Explanation**

Let’s explain the code in details:

- Import the necessary libraries to create the Web server.

```python
try:
  import usocket as socket
except:
  import socket

import network
```
- Import `Pin` class from the `machine` ; import `dht` to read data from the DHT sensor.

```python
from machine import Pin
import dht
```
- The dht sensor needs to be initialized by creating a DHT instance on GPIO 13.

```python
sensor = dht.DHT11(Pin(13))
```
- Add your network name and password.

```python
ssid = 'REPLACE_WITH_YOUR_SSID'
password = 'REPLACE_WITH_YOUR_PASSWORD'
```
- Create a function called `read_sensor()` to read the temperature and humidity measured by the DHT sensor.

```python
def read_sensor():
```
- The function first creates two global variables, so we can use them in all parts of the script (they are initialized to 0).

```python
global temp, hum
temp = hum = 0
```
`temp` holds the temperature read from the sensor, `hum` holds the humidity read from the sensor.

- Use `try` and `except` statements. In the `try` , we try to get the temperature and humidity values, we measure the sensor by `measure()` on the `sensor` object.

```python
try:
 sensor.measure()
```
- `sensor.temperature()` reads the temperature and `humidity()` reads the humidity. Save these readings in `temp` and `hum` .

```python
temp = sensor.temperature()
hum = sensor.humidity()
```
- Valid temperature and humidity readings should be of type float (if you use a DHT22 sensor) or type int (if you use a DHT11 sensor). Therefore, before proceeding, we check to see if there is a valid reading by `isinstance()`.

```python
if (isinstance(temp, float) and isinstance(hum, float)) or (isinstance(temp, int) and isinstance(hum,int)):
```
**ATTENTION:** `isinstance()` accepts variables and data types as parameters: `isinstance(variable, data type)`. Return `True` if the variable corresponds to the inserted data type. Return `False` if not.

- If the reading is valid, the “Shell” shows the temperature and humidity values.

```python
msg = (b'{0:3.1f},{1:3.1f}'.format(temp, hum))
```
- If you want to display the temperature in Fahrenheit, please uncomment # on the following line.

```python
# temp = temp * (9/5) + 32.0
```
- The humidity reading is rounded to two decimal places and will be printed later on the web server page.

```python
hum = round(hum, 2)
```
- Return a message with temperature and humidity.

```python
return(msg)
```
- If you do not get a valid sensor values(not of type float), return `Invalid sensor readings` .

```python
else:
    return('Invalid sensor readings.')
```
- If the data cannot be read from the sensor (for example, if the sensor is disconnected), return an error message.

```python
except OSError as e:
  return('Failed to read sensor.')
```
-  `web_page()` returns the HTML page and browses each line of the HTML to see what it does;  `<meta>` makes your web page responsive in any browser;  `<link>` loads the ICONS used in web pages from the fontawesome website.

```python
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/font-awesome/6.5.1/css/all.min.css">
```
- Between `<style>` and `</style>` , we add some CSS to style the page.

```python
  <style>html {
     font-family: Arial;display: inline-block;margin: 0px auto;text-align: center;}
    h2 { font-size: 3.0rem; }p { font-size: 3.0rem; }.units { font-size: 1.2rem; }.dht-labels{font-size: 1.5rem;vertical-align:middle;padding-bottom: 15px;}
    </style>
```
- Set the HTML page to use Arial font to display text in the module, without margins, and aligned in the center.

```python
html {
     font-family: Arial;display: inline-block;margin: 0px auto;text-align: center;}
```
- set the font size for headings(`h2`), paragraphs(`p`), and reading units(`.units`) .

```python
h2 { font-size: 3.0rem; } p { font-size: 3.0rem; }.units { font-size: 1.2rem; }
```
- The label style for the reading material is shown below.

```python
dht-labels{font-size: 1.5rem;vertical-align:middle;padding-bottom: 15px;}
```
- One shows temperature, the other humidity; Paragraphs are separated by `<p>` and `</p>` . The paragraphs on temperature and humidity are as follows:

```python
  <p>
    <i class="fas fa-thermometer-half" style="color:#059e8a;"></i> 
    <span class="dht-labels">Temperature</span> 
    <span>"""+str(temp)+"""</span>
    <sup class="units">&deg;C</sup>
  </p>
  <p><i class="fas fa-tint" style="color:#00add6;"></i> 
    <span class="dht-labels">Humidity</span>
    <span>"""+str(hum)+"""</span>
    <sup class="units">%</sup>
  </p>
```
- To select a color, you just need to pass the style parameter of the hexadecimal color, as follows:

```python
<i class="fas fa-tint" style="color:#00add6;"></i> 
```
- In `while` loop, when we call `read_sensor()` to print the values of the sensor and update the global variables `temp` and `hum` .
```python
sensor_readings = read_sensor()
print(sensor_readings) 
```
- Call `web_page()` to make the sensor’s latest reading generate HTML text.
```python
response = web_page()
```

**1. Overview**

**LED:** Its full name is light-emitting diode made of compounds containing gallium (Ga), arsenic (As), phosphorus (P), nitrogen (N), etc. When electrons are combined with holes, visible light is emitted. So they can be used to produce light-emitting diodes. Except by components, they can also be divided into organic ones(OLED) and inorganic ones(LED). 

|     LED components      | Emitting light colors |
| :---------------------: | :-------------------: |
| gallium arsenide diode  |          red          |
| gallium phosphide diode |         green         |
|  silicon carbide diode  |        yellow         |
|  gallium nitride diode  |         blue          |

LED is used as an indicator in circuits and instruments, or as part of a text or numeric display. In this project, we connect an external LED to digital pin IO26.

An LED is a semiconductor known as a "light-emitting diode", which is made of semiconductor materials (silicon, selenium, germanium, etc.). It is polar. The short pin is negative that connects to GND, while the long one is positive that connects to 3.3V or 5V.

![Img](./media/img-20230213165602.png)

- Here is the detailed introduction for the LED: [LED - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light-emitting_diode)

**(2) Five-color-ring Resistor**

A resistor limits or regulates the flow of current in the circuit. The left picture is the appearance of the resistor and the right one is its circuit symbol. Its unit of R is ohm(Ω). 1 MΩ= 1000 kΩ, 1 kΩ = 1000Ω.

![Img](./media/img-20230213165612.png)   

We can use resistors to protect sensitive components, like LED. The resistance(Ω) is marked on the body with an electronic color code. Each color represents a number, and you can refer to it in the resistance card.

-ring 1 – 1st Digit.
-ring 2 – 2nd Digit.
-ring 3 – 3rd Digit.
-ring 4 – Multiplier.
-ring 5 – Tolerance.

![Img](./media/img-20230213165620.png)

In this kit, we provide four five-color-ring resistor. Here we take three of them as examples.

220Ω resistor *10

![Img](./media/img-20230213165647.png)

10KΩ resistor *10

![Img](./media/img-20230213165705.png)

1KΩ resistor *10

![Img](./media/img-20230213165715.png)

- You can learn more about resistor from Wiki: [Resistor - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resistor)

In the same voltage, there will be less current but more resistance. The connection between current(I), voltage(V), and resistance(R) can be expressed: I=U/R. In the figure below, for instance, if the voltage is 3V, the current through R1 equals I = U / R = 3 V / 10 KΩ= 0.0003A= 0.3mA.

![Img](./media/img-20230213165731.png)

- You can learn more about Ohm’s Law from Wiki: [Ohm’s Law - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ohm%27s_law)

Don’t connect a low resistance directly to the two poles of the power supply, as this will cause excessive current to damage the electronic components. Resistors are nonpolar.

**(3) Breadboard**

Breadboards are used to build and test circuits quickly before completing any circuit design. There are many holes in the breadboard so that components such as resistors can be inserted into it. 

A typical breadboard is shown below:

![Img](./media/img-20230213165744.png)

The breadboard comes with many metal strips that run underneath the board to connect holes together. They are laid out as shown below. Note that the top and bottom rows of holes are connected horizontally, while the remaining holes are connected vertically.

![Img](./media/img-20230213165753.png)

The first two rows (top) and the last two rows (bottom) are used for power positive(+) and negative(-) respectively. The conductive layout is shown below:

![Img](./media/img-20230213165803.png)

We should know that the up and low holes of groove in the middle are not connected. So we can connect the DIP(Dual in-line Packages) components (say, integrated circuits, microcontrollers, chips, etc.) as shown below:

![Img](./media/img-20230213165816.png)

![Img](./media/img-20230213165822.png)

**7. Code Explanation**

1\. Import the Pin class from the machine module so that its functions can be used.

```python
from machine import Pin
```
2\. Import the time class so that its functions can be used.

```python
import time
```

3\. Set the LED pin and output mode.

```python
machine.Pin(id,mode,pull,value)
```
- `id`: GPIO number. The value ranges from 0 to 29. If GPIO26 is used, enter 26.

- `mode`: the pin mode. It can be one of the following:
  - `Pin\.IN(0)` - Pin configuration to input;
  
   - `Pin.OUT(1)` - Pin configuration to (normal) output;
  
   - `Pin.OPEN_DRAIN(2)` - Pin configuration to open drain output;
  
- `pull`: whether the pin is connected to a (weak) pull resistance. Valid only in input mode and can be one of the following:
  - `None` - No pull or pull down resistance;
  
   - `Pin.PULL_UP(1)` - The pull-up resistor is enabled.
  
   - `Pin.PULL_DOWN(2)` - The pull-down resistor is enabled.
  
- `value`: Valid only for Pin.OUT and Pin.OPEN_DRAIN. Specify the initial output pin value, otherwise the state of the pin peripheral remains unchanged. 0 is low (off) and 1 is high (on).

  - `Pin.on()` - Set the pin to high
  
   - `Pin.off()` - Set the pin to low

4\. Set LED pin to IO26, output mode. 

```python
led = Pin(26, Pin.OUT) 
```
Q: Why Output mode?

A: The code is set to the main board. For the board, this io11 pin is set to output mode, which outputs high and low levels for the module connected to this pin.

5\. `while True:` The statements below this function execute in a loop.

while:

```python
while (condition)：
    (statements)……
```

6\. LED on/off

```python
led.value(1)   # LED on
time.sleep(1)  # delay 1s
led.value(0)   # LED off
time.sleep(1)  # delay 1s
```
   - `led.value(1)`: Output high level (1) on the IO pin of the main control board; That is, input a high level (1) to the led to turn on LED.
   
   - `led.value(0)`: Output low level (0) on the IO pin of the main control board; That is, input low level (0) to the led to turn off LED.
   
   - `time.sleep(1)`: The program is delayed by 1 second.

Q : Why delay?

Input the high level to the LED module, and the LED will always be on. Set a delay of 1 second, and the LED will only stay on for 1 second. Then continue to run the rest of the program.

A : Control the time when the LED lights on and off by setting the delay.

### 2-3-02 Breathing LED

![Img](./media/img-20250120165337.png)

---

**1. Overview**

In previous studies, we control LED on/off state through digital output. Herein, we adopt PWM to light and dim the LED gradually. PWM is a technology that allows us to control the brightness of an LED or the speed of a motor by changing the duty cycle of a square-wave signal.

With PWM, instead of simply turning the LED on or off, we adjust the time the LED lights up and the time it turns off within each cycle, so that the LED will “breathe” evenly.

This breathing lighting adds a dynamic effect, attracting eyes. 

---

**2. Working Principle**

![Img](./media/img-20240823170617.png)

**Analog / Digital signal** 

An Analog Signal is a continuous signal in both time and value. On the contrary, a Digital Signal is a time series consisting of a sequence of quantities. Most signals in life are analog signals. A familiar example of an Analog Signal would be how the temperature throughout the day is continuously changing and could not suddenly change instantaneously from 0℃ to 10℃. However, Digital Signals can instantaneously change in value. This change is expressed in numbers as 1 and 0 (binary). Their differences can more easily be seen when compared when graphed as below. 

![Img](./media/img-20240823170648.png)

**PWM:**

Pulse Width Modulation, is a very effective method for using digital signals to control analog circuits. Common processors cannot directly output analog signals. PWM technology makes it very convenient to achieve this conversion (translation from digital to analog signals). 

PWM technology uses digital pins to send certain frequencies of square waves, that is, the output of high levels and low levels, which alternately last for a certain period. The total time is generally fixed, which is called the **period** (`the reciprocal of the period is frequency`). The time of high level outputs are generally called “pulse width”, and the duty cycle is the percentage of the ratio of pulse duration, or pulse width (PW) to the total period (T) of the waveform. The longer the high levels last, the longer the duty cycle and the higher the corresponding voltage in the analog signal will be. 

The following figures show how the analog signal voltages vary between 0V-3.3V (high level is 3.3V) corresponding to the pulse width 0%-100%.

![Img](./media/img-20230213173952.png)

![Img](./media/img-20230213173933.png)

PWM is widely applied to adjust light brightness, motor rotation speed and sound production. Here are three parameters of it.

![Img](./media/img-20230213174001.jpg)

1\. Duty cycle: The duration proportion of high level to the total period

2\. Period: The reciprocal of the pulse frequency in one second

3\. On the ESP32, the LEDC(PWM) controller comes with 16 independent channels, each of which can independently control frequency, duty cycle and accuracy.

The longer the PWM duty cycle is, the higher the output power will be. So we can use PWM to control the brightness of an LED or the speed of DC motor. PWM is not real analog, but the effective value of the voltage is equivalent to the corresponding analog. Therefore, we can control the output power of modules. 

**ESP32 and PWM**

On the ESP32, the LEDC(PWM) controller boasts 16 independent channels, each of which can independently control frequency, duty cycle, and even accuracy. Unlike traditional PWM pins, the ESP32’s PWM output pins are configurable, with one or more PWM output pins per channel. The relationship between maximum frequency and bit accuracy is shown below:

![Img](./media/img-20241111101414.png)

The maximum of bits is 31. For example, generate PWM with 10-bit precision(2ˆ10 = 1024, ranging from 0 to 1023).

**4. Wiring Diagram** 

Here we use digital pin IO26. We connect the LED to a 220Ω resistor to avoid high current damage to the LED.

**Schematic diagram:**

![Img](./media/img-20241122170438.png)

The pin in this experiment is the same as “Hello，LED!” but the signal type is not. In the last project, IO26 outputs digital high/low levels (0 & 1) to turn on/off LED, while here IO26 outputs PWM signals to adjust the brightness of the LED.

**7. Code Explanation**

1\. Import Pin, PWM and time.

```python
import time
from machine import Pin,PWM
```
2\. Set a `PWM` to control the LED connected to pin 26, and set PWM signal frequency to 10000 Hz.

```python
pwm =PWM(Pin(26,Pin.OUT),10000)
```
3\. loop: fade in and out LED. External `while True` always runs. Two nested `for` loop is used to gradually increase and decrease the brightness of the LED. Duty cycle ranges from 0 to 1023, representing 0% to 100% duty cycle.

```python
while True:
    for i in range(0,1023): 
       pwm.duty(i)
       time.sleep_ms(1)
            
    for i in range(0,1023):
       pwm.duty(1023-i)
       time.sleep_ms(1)
```
- `range()`: Create a sequence of integers from 0 to 1023.

- PWM signal Duty cycle `duty()`

- `time.sleep_ms()`: Pause the execution of the program for 1 millisecond between each iteration of the loop, thereby gradually increasing brightness over time.

### 2-3-05 RGB LED

![Img](./media/img-20250121083050.png)

---

**1. Overview**

RGB LED combines three primary color (red, green and blue) pins that share a common cathode and whose anode pins control the intensity of the corresponding color. By varying the strength of the electrical signal applied to each anode, it produces a wide variety of colors. For example, mix high-intensity red and green to show yellow, while blue and green to cyan.

In this project, we will introduce the principles of additive color mixing and display colors with RGB LED.

RGB LED (red, green, and blue) are packaged in a transparent/translucent plastic housing. It can display a variety of colors by changing the input voltage of the three pins, which can statistically produce 16,777,216 different colors.

**Features:**

- Color: Three colors (Red/Green/blue)
- Common cathode
- 5mm transparent round lens
- Forward voltage: Red: DC 2.0-2.2V; Blue Green: DC 3.0-3.2V (IF=20mA)
- 0.06 watt DIP RGB LED
- Brightness up to + 20%
- Viewing Angle: 30°

**Common anode and common cathode:**

For common cathode RGB LED, three pins share a negative connection (cathode).

For common anode RGB LED, three pins share a positive connection (anode).

**In this kit, the RGB LED is a common cathode one.**

**RGB LED pins:**

There are 4 pins: the longest is GND; The others are red, green and blue. Place the RGB led as shown, the second from the left being the longest pin. So the pin numbers should be red, GND, green and blue.

![Img](./media/img-20241111115946.png)

You can also use the multimeter “**diode**” test mode to press the connection as shown to measure the color of each pin.

![Img](./media/img-20241111130056.png)

**Mixed color:**

Three colors can be combined in different intensities to generate additional colors, and intensities can be controlled by PWM.

Because they are so close to each other, so our eyes see the result of a combination rather than colors alone.

Take a look at the image below and you may understand how different colors are produced.

- Here is the detailed introduction for a dditive color of the RGB: [Additive color - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Additive_color)

![Img](./media/img-20241111130219.png)

The brightness of RGB LED can be adjusted by PWM.

You can also use the following code to set the color you want; the color value is 0~255;

Here, we can choose our favorite color in the drawing software and display it with RGB LED.

Open “Thonny IDE” and choose “This Computer” → “D:” → “Codes” → “MicroPython_Code”. Open the file “2-3-05_RGB_LED.py” or copy and paste the following code into“Thonny IDE”.

```python
'''

'''
from machine import Pin, PWM
import time

# Define the GPIO pins for the RGB LED

    time.sleep(1)
    set_color(255, 255, 0) # Yellow
    time.sleep(1)
    set_color(255, 0, 255) # Purple
    time.sleep(1)

    time.sleep(1)
    set_color(255, 255, 255) # White
    time.sleep(1)
```

**Note:** This code maps color values from 0 to 255 to duty cycles from 0 to 1023.

**7. Code Explanation**

1\. `interval_mapping` is used to map values from one range to another. It accepts five parameters: the input value, the minimum and maximum value of the input range, and the minimum and maximum value of the output range. It maps the return input value to the output range.

```python
def color_to_duty(rgb_value):
    rgb_value = int(interval_mapping(rgb_value,0,255,0,1023))
    return rgb_value
```
2\. `color_to_duty` takes an integer RGB value (e.g. 255,0,255) and maps it to the duty cycle appropriate for the PWM pin. `interval_mapping` maps the input RGB values from 0-255 to 0-1023. `interval_mapping` output is returned as the duty cycle ratio.

```python
def color_to_duty(rgb_value):
    rgb_value = int(interval_mapping(rgb_value,0,255,0,1023))
    return rgb_value
```
3\. `color_set` accepts three integer parameters: the red, green, and blue values of the LED. These values are passed to `color_to_duty` to obtain the duty cycle of the PWM pin. `duty` sets the duty cycle for the corresponding pin.

```python
def set_color(red_value,green_value,blue_value):
    red.duty(color_to_duty(red_value))
    green.duty(color_to_duty(green_value))
    blue.duty(color_to_duty(blue_value))
```

### 2-3-06 74HC595N

![Img](./media/img-20250121083333.png)

---

**1. Overview**

The 74HC595 chip has multiple output pins that can be connected in series to control the sequence of LED lighting. So it can be used to control 8 outputs at once, taking up only a few pins on microcontroller. In addition, multiple registers can connects to each other for further output expansion. 

In this project, we will use 74HC595 chip to turn on/off 8 LEDs. They just like a rainbow shining colorful lights. In addition, thanks to the scalability of the chip, we can easily add more leds to the display for an even more spectacular effect.

---

**2. Component Knowledge**

![Img](./media/img-20240823195026.png)

Have you ever found yourself wanting to control a lot of leds, or just needing more I/O pins to control buttons, sensors, and servos? Well, you can connect some sensors to the Arduino pins, but you’ll run out of Arduino pins pretty quickly.

The solution is to use “shift registers” that allows you to expand the number of I/O pins from the Arduino (or any microcontroller). The 74HC595 shift register is one of the most famous.

The 74HC595 essentially controls eight separate output pins, using only three input pins. If you need more than 8 additional I/O lines, you can easily cascade any number of shift registers and create a large number of I/O lines. All of this is done through what’s called a shift register.

- [74HC595 Datasheet](https://www.ti.com/lit/ds/symlink/cd74hc595.pdf?ts=1617341564801)

**Features:**

- 8-bit serial input, parallel output shift;
- Operating voltage range 2V to 6V;
- High current tri-state output can drive up to 15LSTTL loads;
- Low power consumption, 80µA Max ICC;
- Typical tPD = 14 ns;
- ±6ma output drive at 5v;
- Low input current, Max. 1µA;
- The shift register has a direct clear function.

**74HC595 pins and function:**

![Img](./media/img-20241111145650.png)

- Q0-Q7: 8-bit parallel data output pins for direct control of 8 leds or 8 7-segment display pins.
- SQR: Series output pin, connecting another 74HC595 DS, series multiple 74HC595
- SCLR: Reset pin, enable at low level;
- SCK: Timing input of the shift register. On the rising edge, the data in the shift register is continuously moved 1 bit, that is, the data from Q1 is moved to Q2, and so on. At the falling edge, the data in the shift register remains unchanged.
- RCK: Stores the timing input of the register. At the rising edge, the data in the shift register is moved to the memory register.
- OE: Output enable pin, enable at low level.
- SI: serial data entry pin
- VCC: positive voltage of the power supply.
- GND: Ground.

**Function diagram:**

![Img](./media/img-20241111150329.png)

**Working Principle**

When SCLR (pin10) is high and OE (pin13) is low, data is entered from the rising edge of SCK and into the memory register via the rising edge of RCK.

- Shift register

	- Suppose we want to input binary data 1110 1110 into the 74hc595 shift register.
	- Data is input from the 0 bit of the shift register.
	- Each time the shift register clock is on a rising edge, the bits in the shift register are shifted by one step. For example, the 7th bit accepts the value before the 6th, the 6th obtains the value of the 5th, and so on.

![Img](./media/img-20241111150634.png)

- Memory register
  - When the storage register is in the rising edge state, the data in the shift register will be transferred to the storage register.
  - Connect the memory register directly to the eight output pins, and Q0 to Q7 can receive one byte of data.
  - The so-called storage register means that data can exist in this register and will not disappear with an output.
  - As long as the 74HC595 is powered on, the data will remain valid and unchanged.
  - When new data appears, the data in the storage register will be overwritten and updated.

**Schematic diagram:**

![Img](./media/img-20240823195859.png)

- When SCLR (pin10) is at a high level and OE (pin13) is at a low level, data is input from the rising edge of SCK and enters the memory register through the rising edge of SCK.
- If two clocks are connected together, the shift register is always one pulse ahead of the memory register.
- In the memory register there is a serial shift input pin (SI), a serial output pin (SQH), and an asynchronous reset button (low level).
- The memory register outputs a bus with parallel 8-bits and three states.
- When OE is enabled (low level), the data in the memory register is output to the bus (Q0 ~ Q7).

**7. Code Explanation**

The above code controls the 8-bit shift register (74595) and outputs different binary values to the shift register, with each value displayed on the LED for a period of time.

1\. Import `machine` and `time`. The `machine` is used to control hardware I/O, while the `time` is used to delay time and others.

```python
import machine
import time
```
2\. `machine.Pin()` initializes three output ports corresponding to the shift register data port (SI), storage clock port (RCK), and shift Register clock port (SCK).

```python
# Initialize the pins for the 74HC595 shift register
si = machine.Pin(5, machine.Pin.OUT)  # SI
rck = machine.Pin(23, machine.Pin.OUT)  # RCK
sck = machine.Pin(18, machine.Pin.OUT)  # SCK
```
3\. Define a function called `hc595_shift()` to write 8-bit data to the shift register.

```python
def hc595_shift(dat):
    # Set the RCLK pin to low
    rck.off()

    # Iterate through each bit (from 7 to 0)
    for bit in range(7, -1, -1):
        # Extract the current bit from the input data
        value = 1 & (dat >> bit)

        # Set the SRCLK pin to low
        sck.off()

        # Set the value of the SDI pin
        si.value(value)

        # Clock the current bit into the shift register by setting the SRCLK pin to high
        sck.on()

    # Latch the data into the storage register by setting the RCLK pin to high
    rck.on()
```
4\. for loop

```python
for i in range(16):
    if i < 8:
        num = (num << 1) + 1  # Shift left and set the least significant bit to 1
    elif i >= 8:
        num = (num & 0b01111111) << 1  # Mask the most significant bit and shift left
    hc595_shift(num)  # Shift the current value into the 74HC595
    print("{:0>8b}".format(num))  # Print the current value in binary format
    time.sleep_ms(200)  # Wait 200 milliseconds before shifting the next value
```
- variable `i` is used to control the binary value of the output. In the first eight iterations, `num` values are, in order, 00000001, 00000011, 00000111, …, 11111111, move 1 bit to the left and add 1.
- In the 9th to 16th iteration, first change the highest bit of 1 to 0, and then move 1 bit left, the output value is 00000010, 00000100, 00001000, …, 10000000.
- In each iteration, `num` value is passed to `hc595_shift()` to control the shift register output corresponding binary values.
- While output binary values, `print()` outputs the binary value as a string to the terminal.
- After output binary value, `time.sleep_ms()` pauses for 200 milliseconds so that the value on the LED remains on for a period of time.

**3. Component Knowledge**

![Img](./media/img-20240823190642.png)

A 7-segment display is an 8-shaped component which packages 7 LEDs. Each LED is called a segment - when energized, one segment forms part of a numeral to be displayed.

- Each of the LEDs in the display is given a positional segment with one of its connection pins led out from the rectangular plastic package.

- These LED pins are labeled from “a” through to “g” representing each individual LED.

- The other LED pins are connected together forming a common pin.

- So by forward biasing the appropriate pins of the LED segments in a particular order, some segments will brighten and others stay dim, thus showing the corresponding character on the display.

**Features:**

- Size: 19 x 12.7 x 13.8mm(LxWxH, include the pin)
- Screen: 0.56’’
- Color: red
- Common Cathode
- Forward Voltage: 1.8V
- 10 pins
- Pitch: standard 0.1” (2.54mm)

**Common Cathode (CC) or Common Anode (CA)**

There are two types of pin connection: Common Cathode (CC) and Common Anode (CA). As the name suggests, a CC display has all the cathodes of the 7 LEDs connected when a CA display has all the anodes of the 7 segments connected.

- Common Cathode 7-Segment Display

![Img](./media/img-20250121091239.png)

- Common Anode 7-Segment Display

![Img](./media/img-20250121091300.png)

**How to Know CC or CA?**

Usually there will be label on the side of the 7-segment display, xxxAx or xxxBx. Generally speaking xxxAx stands for common cathode and xxxBx stands for common anode.

![Img](./media/img-20250121091854.png)

You can also use a multimeter to check the 7-segment display if there is no label. Set the multimeter to diode test mode and connect the black lead to the middle pin of the 7-segment display, and the red lead to any other pin except the middle one. The 7-segment display is common cathode if a segment lights up.

You swap the red and black meter heads if there is no segment lit. When a segment is lit, it indicates a common anode.

**Display Codes**

To help you get to know how 7-segment displays(Common Cathode) display Numbers, we have drawn the following table. Numbers are the number 0-F displayed on the 7-segment display; (DP) GFEDCBA refers to the corresponding LED set to 0 or 1.

![Img](./media/img-20250121092006.png)

For example, 01011011 means that DP, F and C are set to 0, while others are set to 1. Therefore, the number 2 is displayed on the 7-segment display.

![Img](./media/img-20250121092036.png)

In this experiment, we use a <span style="color: rgb(255, 76, 65);">common cathode one-bit digital tube</span> 。 As we mentioned above, we connect the common cathode to GND and set pin to “HIGH” to light it up.

**7. Code Explanation**

Herein, we use `hc595_shift()` function writes the binary number to the Shift register.

Suppose it displays numbers “2”. The **f** , **c** and **dp** should turn off (low), while **a** , **b** , **d** , **e** and **g** should be turn on (high). “01011011” is binary and “0x5b” is hexadecimal.

Thus, `hc595_shift(0x5b)` is required to show number “2” on the display.

[Hexadecimal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hexadecimal)

[BinaryHex Converter](https://www.binaryhexconverter.com/binary-to-hex-converter)

The following table shows the hexadecimal pattern that needs to be written to the shift register in order to display the numbers 0 ~ 9.

Write these codes to `hc595_shift()` to display the corresponding number.

### 2-3-08 4-bit Digital Tube

![Img](./media/img-20250121083639.png)

---

**1. Overview**

4-bit Digital Tube is very practical for devices such as electronic clocks, score counters and counters of number. In this project, we use ESP32 board to control it to display four digits 0000-9999.

---

**2. Component Knowledge**

For common cathode or anode, their working principle is similar to that of 1-bit Digital Tube. Yet there are four bits on this module, so 4 GPIO pins are required to light up one bit. The shift is too fast to be caught by human eyes, so it looks like the bits light up at the same time. In this experiment, we use a common cathode four-bit digital tube.

Here are the pins, among which G1, G2, G3 and G4 are used to control bit.

### 2-3-09 Buzzer Beep

![Img](./media/img-20250121083755.png)

---

**1. Overview**

Active buzzer is a sound component that is widely used as a sound component for computers, printers, alarms ,electronic toys and phones, timers etc. It comes with an internal vibration source, so it can continuously buzz after connecting to 5V power supply. 

In this project, we will use ESP32 board to control the active buzzer to beep.

---

**2. Component Knowledge**

**(1) Active Buzzer**

![Img](./media/img-20240826084218.png)

In the active buzzer, a simple oscillator circuit is integrated to convert constant direct current into pulse signals with a certain frequency. Once it receives a high level, it will emit sound. 

However, passive buzzer is without vibration source, so it must be driven by 2k ~ 5k square waves, rather than a DC signal. 

They are very similar in appearance, but the passive one buzzer is with a green circuit board, while the active one is with black tape. Passive buzzers are not polar, yet active ones are. 

![Img](./media/img-20240826084416.png)

- You can learn more about buzzer from Wiki: [Buzzer - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buzzer)

**(2) Transistor**

As buzzer requires large current but GPIO of ESP32 output capability cannot meet this requirement, a NPN transistor is needed to amplify the current. 

![Img](./media/img-20240826090124.png)

Transistor is a semiconductor that controls current. It amplifies weak signals or works as a non-contact switch. 

According to structures, it can be divided into NPN and PNP. Both of them comes with three electrodes: base(B), collector(C) and emitter(E). The PN junction between E and B is also named “emitting junction”, and that between C and B is also called “collecting junction”. 

- You can learn more about transistor from Wiki: [P-N junction - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P%E2%80%93n_junction)

As shown below, the arrow points to the direction of current flow.

![Img](./media/img-20240913130716.png)

![Img](./media/img-20240913133904.png)

When there is current passing between “BE”, “CE” will allow several-folded current pass (amplified by the transistor). At this point, transistor works in the amplifying area. When current between “BE” exceeds a certain value, “CE” will not allow current to increase any longer. Now the transistor works in the saturation area.

Here are the two types of transistor: PNP and NPN

![Img](./media/img-20240826084842.png)

***In this kit, we mark PNP transistor as 8550, and NPN as 8050.***

It is often used as a switch in digital circuits. As microcontroller's capacity to output current is very weak, transistor is a perfect choice to amplify current and drive large-current components. 

NPN transistor drives buzzer: If GPIO outputs high, current will flow through R1, the transistor will get conducted, and the buzzer will emit sound. If GPIO outputs low, no current flows through R1, so the transistor will not be conducted to enable buzzer to sound. 

PNP transistor drives buzzer: If GPIO outputs low, current will flow through R1, the transistor will get conducted, and the buzzer will emit sound. If GPIO outputs high, no current flows through R1, so the transistor will not be conducted to enable buzzer to sound.

**7. Code Explanation**

If passive buzzer is given a digital signal, it can only push the diaphragm without producing sound. Therefore, we use `tone()` to produce a PWM signal that makes passive buzzer sound.

This function takes three parameters:

- `pin`: pin that controls the buzzer.
- `frequency`:The tone of the buzzer is determined by the frequency, the higher the frequency is, the higher the tone will be.
- `frequency`: Duration of tone.

`duty()` sets the duty cycle to 512 (about 50%). It could be any other number, it just needs to generate a break.

- `tone()` uses the `pin` object’s `freq` to set the pin’s `frequency` to the frequency value.
- `pin` object’s `duty` sets the duty cycle of the pin to 512.
- The pin produces a tone with a specified frequency and volume, `duration` is measured in milliseconds, using the sleep_ms of the time module.

- The code plays the melody by iterating over a sequence called `melody`, and calls `tone` for each note in the melody by the frequency and duration of the note.
- The time module `sleep_ms` inserts a short pause of 50 milliseconds between each note.

**3. Component Knowledge**

![Img](./media/img-20241121144450.png)

**130 motor:**

It uses HR1124S motor control chip that is a single channel H-bridge driver chip used in DC motor solutions. The H-bridge driving part adopts PMOS and NMOS power tubes with low on-resistance, which ensures low power loss of the chip and makes the chip work safely for a longer time. In addition, the HR1124S supports low standby current and low static operating current, which makes the 130 motor module easy to use in toys.

**130 motor parameters:**

- Operating voltage: 5V
- Operating current: ≤200MA
- Operating power: 2W
- Operating temperature: -10℃~+50℃

**130 motor working principle:**

The HR1124S chip helps drive the motor, which cannot be driven by a triode or directly driven by an IO port because of the large current required by the motor. 

The motor can be turned by adding a voltage to both ends. If the voltage direction is different, the direction of rotation of the motor is not the same. Within the limit voltage, the higher the voltage is, the faster the motor will rotate; On the other hand, the lower the voltage is, the slower the motor will rotate, or stop.

There are two control methods: one is high and low level (control on and off), and the other is PWM(control speed).

### 2-3-12 Servo Rotation

![Img](./media/img-20250121084408.png)

---

**1. Overview**

A servo is a position-based device capable of maintaining a specific Angle and providing precise rotation angles. So it is ideal for applications that require consistent Angle adjustment, such as remote controlled toys, airplane models, submarine replica, as well as complex robots.

In this project, we control the servo to rotate to certain angles.

Are you ready for servo to dance to your tune? Let’s go on this exciting journey!

**3. Principle**

![Img](./media/img-20240826092941.png)

**Servo** is a kind of position driver, which is mainly composed of housing, DC motor, circuit board, variable gear group with torque, a potentiometer and a control board.

![Img](./media/img-20240826092722.png)

The angle range of most servos is 180 degrees. 

As the output torque of the servos is higher than that of DC motors, so they are widely used to control model of cars, planes and robots. 

Generally, servo comes with three wires, two of which are used for the power positive (2-positive wire, red) and negative (3-negative wire, brown). The remaining one is for signal (1-signal wire, orange). 

![Img](./media/img-20240826092747.png)

We drive the servo via PWM signals, whose duty cycle is fixed and frequency is 50Hz. In a single PWM cycle, the high level duration is 0.5ms ~ 2.5ms, which corresponds linearly to 0° ~ 180° of the servo. Some corresponding values are as follows:

![Img](./media/img-20240826092756.png)

Change the signal value of the servo and it will rotate to the specified angle. 

**Note that** the angle may vary from servos of different brands after receiving the same signal.

**8. Code Explanation**

1\. Create a PWM (pulse width modulation) object on pin 4 and set its frequency to 50 Hz. This is common for servos.

```python
# Create a PWM (Pulse Width Modulation) object on Pin 25
servo = machine.PWM(machine.Pin(4))

# Set the frequency of the PWM signal to 50 Hz, common for servos
servo.freq(50)
```
2\. `interval_mapping` maps values from one range to another. This will be used to convert the Angle to the appropriate pulse width and duty cycle.

```python
# Define a function for interval mapping
def interval_mapping(x, in_min, in_max, out_min, out_max):
    return (x - in_min) * (out_max - out_min) / (in_max - in_min) + out_min
```
3\. `servo_write` takes a PWM object and an Angle as input. It calculates the pulse width and duty cycle based on the given Angle and then sets the PWM output accordingly.

```python
# Define a function to write an angle to the servo
def servo_write(pin, angle):

    pulse_width = interval_mapping(angle, 0, 180, 0.5, 2.5) # Calculate the pulse width
    duty = int(interval_mapping(pulse_width, 0, 20, 0, 1023))     # Calculate the duty cycle
    pin.duty(duty) # Set the duty cycle of the PWM signal
```
- In this function, `interval_mapping()` maps the Angle range 0 ~ 180 to the pulse width range 0.5 ~ 2.5ms.
- Why 0.5~2.5? This is driven by servo work model.
- Next, the pulse width is converted from period to duty cycle.
- Since `duty()` cannot be used with decimals (values cannot be of type float), `int()` is used to convert duty to type int.

4\. Create an infinite loop with two nested loops.

```python
while True:
    # Loop through angles from 0 to 180 degrees
    for angle in range(180):
        servo_write(servo, angle)
        time.sleep_ms(20)

    # Loop through angles from 180 to 0 degrees in reverse
    for angle in range(180, -1, -1):
        servo_write(servo, angle)
        time.sleep_ms(20)
```
- The first nested for loop iterates from 0 to 180 degrees, and the second iterates in turn from 180 to 0 degrees.
- On each iteration, `servo_write` is called at the current Angle and a delay of 20 milliseconds is added.

### 2-3-13 Stepper Motor

![Img](./media/img-20240826100852.png)

---

**1. Overview**

In this project, we will control stepper motor(28BYJ-48) with ULN2003 driver and the ESP32 main board. They are used in a variety of applications, such as 3D printers, CNC machines, robots, and common household appliances. Their precise control allows for complex movements, making them ideal for projects requiring high positioning accuracy.

The 28BYJ-48 stepper motor here will rotate in different speed and direction. By understanding how to control the stepper motors, you will smoothly integrate them into your own electronics projects.

---

**2. Component Knowledge** 

![Img](./media/img-20240826100659.png)

**Stepper Motor**

It is a motor controlled by a series of electromagnetic coils. It can rotate by the exact number of degrees (or steps) needed, allowing you to move it to a precise position and keep it there. It does this by supplying power to the coil inside the motor in a very short time, but you must always supply power to the motor to keep it in the position you want. There are two basic types of stepping motors, namely uni-polar stepping motor and bipolar stepping motor. In this project, we use a 28-BYJ48 uni-polar stepper motor.

![Img](./media/img-20240826100852.png)

**28BYJ-48 Working Principle**

The stepper motor is mainly composed of a stator and a rotor. The stator is fixed. As shown in the figure below, the part of the coil group A, B, C, and D will generate a magnetic field when the coil group is energized. The rotor is the rotating part. As follows, the middle part of the stator, two poles are permanent magnets.

![Img](./media/img-20240826100943.png)

Single -phase four beat: At the beginning, the coils of group A are turned on, and the poles of the rotor point at A coil. Next, the group A coil are disconnected, and the group B coils are turned on. The rotor will turn clockwise to the group B. Then, group B is disconnected, group C is turned on, and the rotor is turned to group C. After that, group C is disconnected, and group D is turned on, and the rotor is turned to group D. Finally, group D is disconnected, group A is turned on, and the rotor is turned to group A coils. Therefore, rotor turns 180° and continuously rotates B-C-D-A, which means it runs a circle (eight phase). As shown below, he rotation principle of stepper motor is A - B - C - D - A...

You make order inverse(D - C - B - A - D .....) if you want to make stepper motor rotate anticlockwise.

![Img](./media/img-20240826101022.png)

Half-phase and eight beat: 8 beat adopts single and dual beat way，A - AB - B - BC - C - CD - D - DA - A ......，rotor will rotate half phase in this order. For example, when A coil is electrified, rotor faces to A coil, then A and B coil are connected, on this condition, the strongest magnetic field produced lies in the central part of AB coil, which means rotating half-phase clockwise.

**Parameters**

The rotor rotates one circle when the stepper motor we provide rotates 32 phases and with the output shaft driven by 1:64 reduction geared set. Therefore the rotation (a circle) of output shaft requires  32 * 64 = 2048 phases.

The step angle of 4-beat mode of 5V and 4-phase stepper motor is 11.25. And the step angle of 8-beat mode is 5.625, the reduction ratio is 1:64.

**Drive Board for ULN2003 Stepper Motor** 

Drive Board for ULN2003 Stepper Motor converts the weak signal into a stronger control signal to drive the stepper motor. 

The following schematic diagram shows how to use the ULN2003 stepper motor driver board interface to connect a unipolar stepper motor to the pins of the ESP32, and shows how to use four TIP120 interfaces.

### 2-3-14 Button

![Img](./media/img-20250121084604.png)

---

**1. Overview**

Button controls the ON/OFF state of a circuit, such as the start-up of electrical devices, light colors and sound volume by control signals and power.

---

**2. Component Knowledge**

If a **button** is connect to a circuit, the circuit is opened when the button is not pressed. Press the button to close the circuit. Before pressing it, current in the circuit is blocked on one side. It is the metal sheet in the button that becomes a bridge for the current to flow over the circuit. 

![Img](./media/img-20240826105527.png)

Button structure: ![Img](./media/img-20240903165613.png)

- Not pressed: 1 and 2 are connected, 3 and 4 are connected, yet 1/2 and 3/4 sides are disconnected.
- Pressed: all are connected.

Button circuit symbol: ![Img](./media/img-20240826105503.png)

Button changes the high/low power levels. Here are three commonly seen circuits:

- Circuit with pull-up resistor
- Circuit with pull-down resistor
- Internal pull-up circuit

**A. Circuit with pull-up resistor**

![Img](./media/img-20240826105941.png)

If the button is released, digital pin 14 will be connected to 5V power through resistor to output high, so digitalRead(14) function returns 1.

If the button is pressed, digital pin 14 is connected to GND to output low, so digitalRead(14) function returns 0. 

Therefore, the 10 KΩ resistor in the circuit is called pull-up resistor.

**B. Circuit with pull-down resistor**

![Img](./media/img-20240826110031.png)

If the button is released, digital pin 14 will be connected to GND to output low, so digitalRead(14) function returns 0.

If the button is pressed, digital pin 14 is connected to 5V power through resistor to output low, so digitalRead(14) function returns 1. 

Therefore, the 10 KΩ resistor in the circuit is called pull-down resistor.

If the digital pin is set to INPUT mode, the following wiring methods are both wrong:

![Img](./media/img-20240826110045.png)

When the button is not pressed, in the left wiring, the digital pin 14 connects to neither power nor ground. This is called suspension, and digitalRead() returns an unsure value, including HIGH or LOW.

When the button is pressed, in the right wiring, the power is directly connect to ground, forming a short sircuit.

Therefore, at INPUT mode, a pull-up/down resistor is essential in a circuit, usually a 10 KΩ resistor. 

**C. Internal pull-up circuit**  

Except those, controller integrates a pull-up resistor of 20KΩ. We can set mode of pinMode() function to INPUT_PULLUP to enable the internal pull up resistor.

After that, an external resistor can be omitted. Here is the internal pull-up circuit diagram:

![Img](./media/img-20240826110127.png)

When the button is not pressed, digitalRead() returns 1. Otherwise it returns 0. In this condition, one terminal of the button is connected to the digital pin, while the other is linked to GND.

**In this project, we adopt the internal pull-up circuit.**

### 2-3-16 Human Nearby or Not

![Img](./media/img-20250121084820.png)

---

**1. Overview**

In this project, we use a PIR motion sensor to detect the surrounding movement. This sensor mainly adopts an RE200B-P sensing component, which detects infrared ray from human or animals. The detection range will be much wider with Fresnel lens. 

We display the test result on the serial monitor by reading the power level of terminal S.

**3. Schematic Diagram**

![Img](./media/img-20240826131711.jpg)

First, the 5V input voltage is converted into a 3.3V input voltage, as the sensor cannot be directly connect to 5V. With this voltage conversion, both 3.3V and 5V input are compatible with this sensor.

When it detects no infrared signals, sensor pin 1 outputs low. There will be a voltage difference between the two ends of LED, so current passes to light LED up; MOS tube Q1 is conducted (Q1 is NPN MOS tube in the model of 2N7002. Pin 1 outputs low, so Q1 source electrode Vs = 0, while Q1 grid electrode Vg = 3.3V, so voltage difference Vgs = 3.3V is greater than Q1 threshold voltage 2.5V. Q1 is conducted). Signal terminal S detects low.

When an infrared signal is detected, pin 1 outputs high and the LED goes off. MOS tube Q1 is not conducted, so the signal terminal S detects a high level pulled up by the 10K resistor.

### 2-3-17 Potentiometer

![Img](./media/img-20250121084859.png)

---

**1. Overview**

Previous sensors are digital ones. The middle value of, for example, 0~3.3V, cannot be read by digital IO ports so they only output high(3.3V) and low(0). Potentiometer is an analog sensor.  Yet, analog sensors are able to read them to output analog values within a range.

Herein, we read the ADC, DAC and voltage values in an analog port with the potentiometer.

---

**2. Component Knowledge**

![Img](./media/img-20240826134553.png)

**Potentiometer Working Principle**

The brush slides on the resistor and obtains the output voltage in a certain relationship with the input voltage in the circuit. 

The potentiometer uses a 10K adjustable resistor. By rotating the handle, we can change the resistance, so the signal S detects a voltage change (0~3.3V). This change is a continuously analog value within 0~3.3V. However, we must first perform ADC acquisition on this analog value for measurement (it converts Analog to Digital, short for ADC). The board has integrated ADC acquisition so can be used directly.

The board default resolution is 12 bits, which means the ADC bits are also 12. An n-bit ADC means that the ADC has a total of 2^n scales. 12-bit ADC outputs a total of 4096 digital values from 0 to 4095, that is, 2^12 scales, with each scale 3.3V/4096 ≈ 0.00080566 V. This is also called resolution.

**ADC**

An ADC is an electronic integrated circuit used to convert analog signals such as voltages to digital or binary form consisting of 1s and 0s. The range of our ADC on the board is 10 bits (The bits of an ADC represent the number of bits of binary used to convert an analog value to a digital one), whose range of numbers that can be stored is 0 ~ 2^12 (i.e. 0 ~ 4095). For instance, reference voltage is 3.3V, so the minimum resolution is 3.3V/4096. 

The rage of analog values correspond to ADC values. So the more bits the ADC has, the denser the partition of analog will be and the greater the precision of the resulting conversion will be.

![Img](./media/img-20240826134915.png)

Ordinate number 0: analog within 0V ~ 3.3/4096 V (abscissa);

Ordinate number 1: analog within 3.3/4096 V ~ 2 * 3.3/4096 V (abscissa);

......

The following analog will be divided accordingly. The conversion formula is as follows:

![Img](./media/img-20240826134901.png)

**DAC**

The reversing of this process requires a DAC, Digital-to-Analog Converter. The digital I/O ports can output high and low level (0 or 1), rather than intermediate voltage values. This is where a DAC works. 

The board boasts DAC with 8-bit accuracy, which can divide VCC (here is 3.3V) into 2^8=256 parts. For example, when the digital value is 1, the output voltage value is 3.3V/256 * 1 = 0.012890625 V; when it is 128, the output voltage value is 3.3V/256 * 128 = 1.65 V. The higher the accuracy of DAC is, the higher the that of output voltage will be.

The conversion formula is as follows:

### 2-3-18 Light Intensity Detection

![Img](./media/img-20250121085022.png)

---

**1. Overview**

Sensors or components are ubiquitous in our daily life. For example, some public street lamps will automatically turn on at night and turn off during the day. Why? In fact, this make use of a photosensitive element that senses the intensity of ambient light. When the outdoor brightness decreases at night, the street lights will turn on automatically; In the daytime, the street lights will automatically turn off. In this Project, we use photoresistor to determine the ambient light intensity. 

---

**2. Component Knowledge**

![Img](./media/img-20240826162506.png)

Based on photoconductivity effect, **photoresistor** is a kind of resistor made of  semiconductor materials such as cadmium sulfide or cadmium selenide, whose resistance changes with the ambient light intensity. The brighter the light is, the lower the resistance will be. 

With the increase of light intensity, the resistance value decreases rapidly to as small as 1KΩ. Its dark resistance is generally up to 1.5MΩ in dark.

![Img](./media/img-20240826162506.png)

To increase sensitivity, the photoresistor's two electrodes are often shaped like a comb. It is non-polar. Here is its circuit symbol:

![Img](./media/img-20240826162531.png)

In the circuit, in order to read the change of photoresistor with light intensity, a resistor needs to be connected in series for voltage division. When the photoresistor resistance changes, the voltage at the analog input pin will change accordingly, and so does the read value. 

The following circuits are used to detect the change of its resistance value:

![Img](./media/img-20240826164643.png)

When the resistance changes due to a change in light intensity, the voltage between R2 and R1 will also change. Thus, the intensity of the light can be obtained by measuring this voltage.

- For more details, please visit: [Photoresistor - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photoresistor)

***In this experiment, figure (a) is adopted. For figure (b), please have a try by yourself!***

### 2-3-19 Flame Detection

![Img](./media/img-20240827101617.png)

---

**1. Overview**

Fire is a terrible disaster and fire alarm systems are very useful in houses、commercial buildings and factories. In this project, we will use the sensor to detect flame.

---

**2. Component Knowledge**

![Img](./media/img-20240827101617.png)

The flame emits a certain amount IR light that is invisible to the human eye, but the **flame sensor** can detect it and alert ESP32 board that a fire has been detected. It comes with a specially designed infrared receiver to detect the flame and convert the flame brightness into a fluctuating level signal. 

The short pin of the receiving triode is negative and the other long pin is positive. We should connect the short pin (negative) to 5V and the long pin (positive) to the analog pin, a resistor and GND.

![Img](./media/img-20240827101645.png)

**ATTENTION:** Since it is vulnerable to radio frequency radiation and temperature changes, the flame sensor should be kept away from heat sources like radiators, heaters and air conditioners, as well as direct irradiation of sunlight, headlights and incandescent light.

### 2-3-20 Thermistor

![Img](./media/img-20250121085121.png)

---

**1. Overview**

Similar to photoresistor, thermistor changes its resistance with temperature. 

We connect the signal end of thermistor to the analog port of the ESP32 board to read the corresponding analog value, voltage and temperature. We can use a formula to calculate the ambient temperature. 

It is widely used in thermometers, gardening and home alarm system.

---

**2. Component Knowledge**

A **thermistor** is a temperature-sensitive resistance. When thermistor senses a change in temperature, its resistance changes. So it can be used to detect temperature. Its circuit symbol is shown below.

![Img](./media/img-20240827110143.png)

As the temperature increases, the resistance decreases, and the voltage at both ends of the 10KΩ resistor (R1) rises, which causes a voltage change of the signal GPIO36.

![Img](./media/img-20240827111228.png)

**NTC thermistor Temperature Calculation Formula: Rt = R * EXP ( B * (1/T1-1/T2) )**

T1 and T2 refer to kelvin degree. K degrees = 273.15(absolute temperature) + degrees Celsius.

**Rt** is the resistance value of thermistor when the ambient temperature is T1 (the current temperature).

**R** is the nominal resistance value of thermistor when the ambient temperature is room temperature T2 (25℃). Referring to the specification, NTC-MF52AT analog temperature sensor we used has a zero power resistance of 10KΩ ± 5% (i.e. R=10K) and T2=(273.15+25) at 25℃.

**B** is the material constant measured at 25 ° C. Reference to the specification shows that B is 3950±1%.

**EXP()** is e^(), e^n.

The relationship between temperature T1 and resistance Rt: T1=1/ (ln(Rt/R) /B+1/T2), where ln can be converted to log, that is, T1=1/ (log(Rt/R)/B +1/T2).

So the only thing we need to know is the value of Rt. 

Back to the schematic diagram above, set the voltage at both ends of thermistor to VRt, and the voltage at both ends of the fixed R1 resistor to VR. So from VR/VRt = R1/Rt: **Rt = R1 *(3.3-VR)/VR**. The VR we actually obtained is the converted analog value, which needs to be converted into a voltage value, i.e. VR = AnalogValue / 4096 * 3.3。

**ATTENTION**: The calculated temperature is Kelvin degrees, so Celsius temperature **t = T1-273.15**, and add an error correction of 0.5.

### 2-3-22 Sound Sensor

![Img](./media/img-20250121085337.png)

---

**1. Overview**

Sound sensor is usually used to detect the loudness of the sound in the surrounding environment. In this project, the sound sensor is controlled by the ESP32 main board to print the ADC value, DAC value and voltage value through code.

---

**2. Component Knowledge**

![Img](./media/img-20241122083636.png)

The sound sensor comes with a capacitive electret microphone that is sensitive to sound. Sound waves cause the electret film to vibrate and the capacitance to change, resulting in a corresponding voltage change. 

Since the voltage change is very weak, amplification is required. Thus, LM358 audio power amplifier chip is used to amplify the sound detected by the high sensitivity microphone with a maximum multiplier of 200 times. When used, we can adjust the amplification by rotating the potentiometer on the sensor(adjust clockwise to the end for maximum).

### 2-3-23 Joystick

![Img](./media/img-20250121085950.png)

---

**1. Overview**

Have you ever seen a game-pad? There are buttons joysticks on it. 

In this kit, there is a joystick made of PS2 controller. We connect the X and Y pins of the module to the analog port and B pin to the digital port. Pin V is connected to the power output (3.3-5V) and G to GND. By reading two analog values and the high/low level of the digital port, the working state of the module can be known.

---

**2. Component Knowledge**

The **joystick** mainly uses PS2 joystick components. In fact, the joystick module has 3 signal terminal pins, which simulate a three-dimensional space. The pins of the joystick module are GND, VCC, and signal terminals (B, X, Y). The signal terminals X and Y simulate the X-axis and Y-axis of the space. When controlling, the X and Y signal terminals of the module are connected to the analog port of the microcontroller. The signal terminal B simulates the Z axis of the space, it is generally connected to the digital port and used as a button.

VCC is connected to the power output V/VCC (3.3/5V), GND is connected to G/GND, the voltage in the original state is about 1.65V/2.5V. 

In the X-axis direction, when moving in the direction of the arrow, the voltage value increases, and the maximum voltage can be reached. Moving in the opposite direction, the voltage value gradually decreases to the minimum voltage. 

In the Y-axis direction, the voltage value decreases gradually as it moves in the direction of the arrow on the module, till to the minimum voltage. As the arrow is moved in the opposite direction, the voltage value increases till to the maximum voltage. 

In the Z-axis direction, the signal terminal B is connected to the digital port and outputs 0 in the original state and outputs 1 when pressed. 

In this way, we can read the two analog values and the high/low level of the digital port to determine the operating status of the joystick.

![Img](./media/img-20241112170753.png)

---

**3. Parameters**

- Operating voltage: DC 3.3V~5V 
- Operating current: 12mA

- Maximum power: 0.06W

- Output signal: Signal terminal X, Y are analog voltage output (analog signal), signal terminal B is digital level output (digital signal)

- Operating temperature: -10°C ~ +50°C

- Dimensions: 47.6mm x 23.8mm x 34.5mm

- Interface: interface spacing 2.54mm

---

**4. Schematic Diagram**

![Img](./media/img-20240829092815.png)

To put it simple, the joystick is equivalent to two potentiometers (left-right and up-down) and a button. 

When the button is not pressed, R1 is pulled down to low. When the button is pressed, VCC is turned on to the high level. Rotate the joystick, and the internal potentiometer is adjusted accordingly, so as to output different voltages and analog values.

### 2-3-24 Temperature and Humidity Detection

![Img](./media/img-20250121085519.png)

---

**1. Overview**

DHT11 temperature and humidity sensor detects humidity and temperature in the air, and its signal transmission distance can reach more than 20 meters. It features ultra-fast response, strong anti-interference ability and high performance.

---

**2. Component Knowledge**

**DHT11 temperature and humidity sensor**

This sensor includes calibrated digital signal output. Its precision of humidity is ±5%RH, temperature is ±2℃, detection range of humidity is 5 ~ 95%RH, and temperature is -25 ~ +60℃. The temperature and humidity sensor applies dedicated digital module acquisition technology and temperature and humidity sensing technology to ensure extremely high reliability and excellent long-term stability of the product. It also integrates a resistive-type humidity measurer and an NTC temperature measurer, which is very suitable for temperature and humidity measurement applications where accuracy and real-time performance are not required.

**Single bus format definition of DHT11 temperature and humidity sensor:**

|      Name       | Definition                                                   |
| :-------------: | :----------------------------------------------------------- |
|  Start signal   | Microprocessor pulls data bus (SDA) down at least 18ms for a period of time(Maximum is 30ms), notifying the sensor to prepare data. |
| Response signal | The sensor pulls the data bus (SDA) low for 83µs, and then pulls up for 87µs to respond to the host's start signal. |
|    Humidity     | The high humidity is an integer part of the humidity data, and the low humidity is a fractional part of the humidity data. |
|   Temperature   | The high temperature is the integer part of the temperature data, the low temperature is the fractional part of the temperature data. And the low temperature Bit8 is 1, indicating a negative temperature, otherwise, it is a positive temperature. |
|   Parity bit    | Parity bit = Humidity high bit + Humidity low bit + temperature high bit+temperature low bit |

**Data sequence diagram of DHT11 temperature and humidity sensor:**

When MCU sends a start signal, the sensor changes from the low-power-consumption mode to the high-speed mode, waiting for MCU completing the start signal. Once it is completed, it sends a response signal of 40-bit data and triggers a signal acquisition. The signal is sent as shown in the figure:

![Img](./media/img-20240829100223.png) 

The communication and synchronization between the MCU and DHT11, adopt single bus data format, with once communication time of about 4ms. The data includes decimal and integer, as described below. The current decimal part is used for future expansion, and now it is zero. 

Operation process: a complete data transmission for 40bit, high bit first.

**Data format:** 8bit Humidity integer + 8bit humidity decimal + 8bit Temperature integer + 8bit temperature decimal +8bit parity sum.

**8-bit parity sum:** The last eight digits of the sum of “8bit Humidity integer + 8bit humidity decimal + 8bit Temperature integer + 8bit temperature decimal”.

Combined with the code, you can understand better.

The sensor can easily add temperature and humidity data to your DIY electronic projects. It is perfect for remote weather stations, home environmental control systems, and farm or garden monitoring systems.

### 2-3-25 Ultrasonic Ranger

![Img](./media/img-20250121085626.png)

**1. Overview**

Bats and some marine animals are able to use high frequencies of sound for echolocation or communication. They can emit ultrasonic waves from the larynx through the mouth or nose and use the sound waves that bounce back to orient and determine the position, size and whether nearby objects are moving.

Ultrasonic is a frequency higher than 20000 Hz sound wave, which has a good direction, a strong penetration ability, and is easy to obtain more concentrated sound energy as well as spread far in the water. It can be used for ranging, speed measurement, cleaning, welding, gravel, sterilization and disinfection. What’s more, it has many applications in medicine, military, industry and agriculture.

Because its lower frequency is greater than the upper limit of human hearing, so it is called ultrasound. The number of vibrations per second is its frequency, whose unit is Hertz (Hz).

In this kit, there is an HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor. It can emit the ultrasonic signals that cannot be heard by humans. When these signals hit an obstacle, they come back immediately. The distance between the sensor and the obstacle can be calculated by the time gap of emitting signals and receiving signals.

---

**2. Parameters**

- Ultrasonic sensor operating voltage: DC 5V 
- Ultrasonic sensor operating current: 15mA

- Ultrasonic sensor operating frequency: 40Hz

- Ultrasonic sensor detection range: 2cm~4m

- Ultrasonic sensor measuring angle: <= 15 degrees

- Ultrasonic sensor input trigger signal: TTL pulse of 10 uS

- Ultrasonic sensor output echo signal: The output TTL level signal is proportional to the range

- Operating temperature: -10°C ~ +50°C

- Ultrasonic sensor dimensions: 45.5mm x 26.7mm x 17.6mm

---

**3. Schematic Diagram**

The most common ultrasonic ranging method is the echo detection. As shown below; when the ultrasonic emitter emits the ultrasonic waves towards certain direction, the counter will count. The ultrasonic waves travel and reflect back once encountering the obstacle. Then the counter will stop counting when the receiver receives the ultrasonic waves coming back.

The ultrasonic wave is also sound wave, and its speed of sound V is related to temperature. Generally, it travels 340m/s in the air. According to time t, we can calculate the distance s from the emitting spot to the obstacle: s=340t/2.

![Img](./media/img-20240830134358.png)

The HC-SR04 ultrasonic ranging module can provide a non-contact distance sensing function of 2cm-400cm, and the ranging accuracy can reach as high as 3mm; the module includes an ultrasonic transmitter, receiver and control circuit. 

(1) First pull down the TRIG, and then trigger it with at least 10us high level signal;

(2) After triggering, the module will automatically transmit eight 40KHZ square waves, and automatically detect whether there is a signal to return.

(3) If there is a signal returned back, through the ECHO to output a high level, the duration time of high level is actually the time from emission to reception of ultrasonic.

(4) Distance = (high level time x speed of sound (340M/S)) / 2

**ATTENTION:**

This module should not be powered on when connecting. If necessary, connect GND first.

The area of the object to be measured should be at least 0.5 square meters and as flat as possible. Otherwise, it will affect the result.

**8. Code Explanation**

1\. For the application of ultrasonic sensor, we can directly check `getDistance()` sub-function. 

getDistance() is used to drive the module to measure the distance; Trig holds a high level of 10us to enable the sensor. Echo.value() is used to read the status of the Echo pin of the ultrasonic sensor. 

Time module `time.sleep_us()` calculates the duration of the Echo, the high level of the Trig pin, measures distance based on the time and returns the value.

```python
def getDistance():
    Trig.value(1)
    time.sleep_us(10)
    Trig.value(0)
    while not Echo.value():
        pass
    pingStart = time.ticks_us()
    while Echo.value():
        pass
    pingStop = time.ticks_us()
    pingTime = time.ticks_diff(pingStop, pingStart) // 2
    distance = int(soundVelocity * pingTime // 10000)
    return distance
```

2\. Delay 2 seconds, wait for the ultrasonic module to stabilize, and print the values from the ultrasonic sensor every 500 milliseconds.

```python
time.sleep(2)
while True:
    time.sleep_ms(500)
    distance = getDistance()
    print("Distance: ", distance, "cm")
```

### 2-3-26 Remote Control and IR Receiving

![Img](./media/img-20250121085702.png)

---

**1. Overview**

An infrared receiver receives infrared signals and can independently detect and output signals that are compatible with TTL levels. It is similar in size to ordinary plastic encapsulated transistors and is commonly used in various applications such as infrared remote control and infrared transmission.

In this project, we will detect signals received by infrared receiver from the remote control. When the button on the remote is pressed and the infrared receiver receives the corresponding signal, it can decode the signal to determine which button was pressed. Therefore, we can identify the specific key or command associated with it.

---

**2. Component Knowledge**

**Remote control:**

It is currently the most common means of communication and remote control. An infrared(IR) remote control is a low-cost and easy-to-use wireless communication technology. IR light is very similar to visible light, except that its wavelength is slightly longer. This means that infrared rays cannot be detected by the human eye, which is perfect for wireless communication. 

For example, when you press a button on the TV remote control, an infrared LED will switch on and off repeatedly at a frequency of 38,000 times per second, transmitting information (such as volume or channel control) to the infrared sensor on the TV. 

As it features small size, low power consumption, strong function and low cost, it is widely used in small electrical equipment, like recorders, audio equipment, air conditioners and electrical toys.

Its transmitting circuit uses infrared light-emitting diode to emit modulated infrared waves. The infrared receiving circuit consists of an infrared receiving diode and a triode / a silicon photocell, which converts the emitted infrared light into corresponding electrical signals and then sends them to the post amplifier.

The remote control in this kit is coded by NEC.

![Img](./media/img-20240829104250.png)

- Dimensions: 86x40x7mm
- Remote control range: about 8-10m
- Battery: 3V button lithium manganese battery
- Infrared carrier frequency: 38KHz
- Effective life: more than 20,000 times

**IR receiver:**

It is the VS1838B infrared receiving sensor element, which can receive infrared light, so it can be used to detect the infrared signal emitted by remote control.

![Img](./media/img-20240830134726.png)

- S: signal output
- GND(-) : GND
- VCC(+) : power supply, 3.3V~5V

IR receiver integrates reception, amplification and demodulation. The received infrared signal has been adjusted in its internal IC (converting the infrared signal back to binary), so the output is a digital signal. It can receive the standard 38KHz modulated remote control signal.

**Infrared signal modulation process diagram:**

![Img](./media/img-20240829103922.png)

- Can be used for remote control
- Wide operating voltage: 2.7~5V
- Internal filter for PCM frequency
- TTL and CMOS compatibility
- Strong anti-interference ability

---

**1. Overview**

In this project, we will learn how to use the keypad that is applied to a variety of devices, including mobile phones, fax machines, microwave ovens, etc. It is often used for user input.

---

**2. Component Knowledge**

This sensor integrates 4x4 = 16 matrix keys:

![Img](./media/img-20240829105511.png)

In a 4x4 key pad, each row / column of keys is connected with a pin, which reduces the processor ports. The internal circuit is shown below.

![Img](./media/img-20240829105521.png)

We detect the state of keys by scanning each column and row. Take the column scanning as an example, send low level to column 1 (Pin1), detect the level status of row 5, 6, 7, 8 to determine whether A, B, C, D are pressed. The low levels are then sent to columns 2, 3, 4 in turn to detect if any other keys have been pressed. Then, you can get the state of all the keys.

### 2-3-29 OLED

![Img](./media/img-20250121090209.png)

---

**1. Overview**

OLED is an organic light-emitting diode that is a device that uses organic materials to display text, graphics and images on a thin, flexible screen. 

Since organic materials emit light when an electric current is applied, OLED emits its own light and requires no other backlight. As a result, OLED displays generally boasts better contrast, brightness and viewing angles compared to LCD displays. 

Another important feature is the deep black level. Since each pixel emits its own light, individual pixels can be turned off in order to produce black.

Due to their low power consumption (only the pixels that are lit consume current), OLED displays are also popular in battery-powered devices and wearables such as smartwatches and fitness trackers. 

---

**2. Component Knowledge**

![Img](./media/img-20240829132814.png)

**OLED** is an organic light-emitting diode, also known as organic dot laser display. It has self-luminous properties, because it uses a very thin coating of organic materials and glass substrate.

It consists of OLED panel and OLED drive chip. 

On the panel, there are may tiny pixels that can emit different colors. Each pixel consists of several layers of organic material sandwiched between two electrodes (anode and cathode). When an electric current flows through the electrode, the organic material emits light at different wavelengths depending on its composition. It uses SSD1306 chip, whose communication mode is IIC. Its dimensions are 0.96 inches, resolution is 128*96 pixels (128 columns, 64 rows of pixels on the screen), and display color is blue.

As for the chip, it converts signals from the Arduino into commands for the panel. The Arduino can send data to the it via a library that can control the I2C protocol, for instance, Adafruit SSD1306 library. Thus, you can initialize OLED display modules, set brightness levels, print text, graphics or images.

**Parameters**

- Operating voltage: DC 3.3V-5V
- Operating current: 30mA
- Interface: Interface spacing 2.54mm
- Communication mode: I2C communication
- Internal driver chip: SSD1306
- Resolution: 128*64
- Viewing Angle: greater than 150°

![Img](./media/img-20240913151650a.png)

---

**7. Code Explanation**

1\. Import Pin, SoftI2C, ssd1306, sleep, gfx library.

```python
from machine import Pin, SoftI2C
import ssd1306
from time import sleep
import gfx
```
2\. ESP32 pin assignment.

```python
i2c = SoftI2C(scl=Pin(22), sda=Pin(21))
```
3\. Set the width, height and i2c of the OLED.

```python
oled_width = 128
oled_height = 64
oled = ssd1306.SSD1306_I2C(oled_width, oled_height, i2c)
```
4\. Clear OLED.

```python
oled.fill(0)
```
5\. Set the relevant content to be displayed at the location specified by the OLED.

```python
oled.text('Hello, World 1!', 0, 0)
oled.text('Hello, World 2!', 0, 10)
oled.text('Hello, World 3!', 0, 20)
oled.text('Hello, World 4!', 0, 30)
oled.text('Hello, World 5!', 0, 40)
oled.text('Hello, World 6!', 0, 50)
        
oled.show()
```
6\. Horizontal roll function: scroll_in_screen(screen), is the content of scrolling in the entire screen (from left to right).

```python
def scroll_out_screen(speed):
  for i in range ((oled_width+1)/speed):
    for j in range (oled_height):
      oled.pixel(i, j, 0)
    oled.scroll(speed,0)
    oled.show()
```
- It accepts a list as an parameter. For example:

```python
screen1 = [[0, 0 , screen1_row1], [0, 16, screen1_row2], [0, 32, screen1_row3]]
```
- Each list contains coordinates x, y, and a message `[x，y，message]`.

- For example, we will display three lines on the first screen that contain the following message.

```python
screen1_row1 = "Screen 1, row 1"
screen1_row2 = "Screen 1, row 2"
screen1_row3 = "Screen 1, row 3"
```
- Call `scroll_in_screen()` so the content on the screen scrolls from left to right, and it passes the list as an parameter:

```python
scroll_in_screen(screen1)
```

7\. Horizontal scrolling. call `scroll_out_screen(speed)` so the contents of the screen scroll out of the OLED. It accepts as a parameter the number that controls the rolling speed. The speed must be `128 (oled_width)`. 

```python
def scroll_out_screen(speed):
  for i in range ((oled_width+1)/speed):
    for j in range (oled_height):
      oled.pixel(i, j, 0)
    oled.scroll(speed,0)
    oled.show()
```
8\. Continuous horizontal scrolling. Call `scroll_screen_in_out(screen)` to make content flow continuously in and out of the screen.

```python
def scroll_screen_in_out(screen):
  for i in range (0, (oled_width+1)*2, 1):
    for line in screen:
      oled.text(line[2], -oled_width+i, line[1])
    oled.show()
    if i!= oled_width:
      oled.fill(0)
```

9\. Vertical scrolling: `scroll_in_screen_v（screen）`

```python
def scroll_in_screen_v(screen):
  for i in range (0, (oled_height+1), 1):
    for line in screen:
      oled.text(line[2], line[0], -oled_height+i+line[1])
    oled.show()
    if i!= oled_height:
      oled.fill(0)
```
10\. Vertical scrolling: Call `scroll_out_screen_v(speed)` to make the content on the screen scroll vertically. Similar to horizontal ones, it accepts as a parameter the number that controls the rolling speed. The speed must be `64 (oled_height)` number.

```python
def scroll_out_screen_v(speed):
  for i in range ((oled_height+1)/speed):
    for j in range (oled_width):
      oled.pixel(j, i, 0)
    oled.scroll(0,speed)
    oled.show()
```
11\. Continuous vertical scrolling. Call `scroll_in_out_screen_v(screen)` to make content go straight continuously in and out of the screen.

```python
def scroll_screen_in_out_v(screen):
  for i in range (0, (oled_height*2+1), 1):
    for line in screen:
      oled.text(line[2], line[0], -oled_height+i+line[1])
    oled.show()
    if i!= oled_height:
      oled.fill(0)
```
12\. Create a GFX object to draw the shape, which accepts the width and height of the drawing area as parameters. If we want to draw the entire OLED, in addition to passing the width and height of the OLED, we should also pass a display function that draws the pixels as a parameter. Here we use `oled.pixel`.

```python
graphics = gfx.GFX(oled_width, oled_height, oled.pixel)
```
13\. Draw lines. On `gfx`, we use `line(x0, y0, x1, y1, color)` to draw a line. `(x0, y0)` represents the starting point of a line; `(x1, y1)` represents the end of the line. 

Call `OLED.show()` to actually display the shape on the OLED.

```python
graphics.line(0, 0, 127, 20, 1)
oled.show()
```
14\. Draw rectangle. On `gfx`, we use `rect(x0, y0, width, height, color)` to draw a rectangle. `(x0, y0)` represents the upper left corner of the rectangle. Then specify its width, height, and color.

```python
graphics.rect(10, 10, 50, 30, 1)
oled.show()
```
15\. Draw a filled rectangle. `fill_rect(x0, y0, width, height, color)` to draw a filled rectangle. Its parameters are same as `drawRect()`.

```python
graphics.fill_rect(10, 10, 50, 30, 1)
oled.show()
```
16\. `circle(x0, y0, radius, color)` draws a circle with `(x0, y0)` as its center.

```python
graphics.circle(64, 32, 10, 1)
oled.show()
```
17\. `fill_circle(x0, y0, radius, color)` draws a filled circle.

```python
graphics.fill_circle(64, 32, 10, 1)
oled.show()
```
18\. `(x0, y0, x1, y1, x2, y2，color)` draws a triangle, with the coordinates and color of each Angle as parameters.

```python
graphics.triangle(10,10,55,20,5,40,1)
oled.show()
```
19\. `fill_triangle(x0, y0, x1, y1, x2, y2, color)` draws a filled triangle.

```python
graphics.fill_triangle(10,10,55,20,5,40,1)
oled.show()
```

### 2-3-30 RFID RC522

![Img](./media/img-20250121090343.png)

---

**1. Overview**

There is a Keyestudio RFID module in the kit. RFIDRFID-RC522 radio frequency module on it adopts a Philips MFRC522 original chip to design card reading circuit, easy to use and low cost, suitable for advanced application, such as equipment development and card reader development. This module can be directly loaded into a variety of card reader model and connected with the user any CPU board or MCU communication through the IIC interface.

In the experiment, the data read by the module is 4 hexadecimal numbers, and we print these four hexadecimal numbers as strings. For example, we read the data of the IC card “0xE7, 0xB9, 0x65, 0x65”, and the information string displayed in the serial monitor is “E7 B9 65 65”; the data read from the keychain is “0xB4, 0xB4, 0xAA, 0xDB”, and the string displayed in the serial monitor is “B4 B4 AA DB”. Sometimes you see only one-bit, because the “0” is omitted. For instance, “0a” will be printed as “a”. Different IC cards and key chains have diverse data.

**3. Schematic Diagram**

![Img](./media/img-20240829140734.png)

**Radio frequency identification(RFID):**

Its card reader is composed of a radio frequency module and a high-level magnetic field. The Tag transponder is a sensing device, and this device does not contain a battery. It only contains tiny integrated circuit chips and media for storing data and antennas for receiving and transmitting signals. To read the data in the tag, first put it into the reading range of the card reader. The reader will generate a magnetic field, and because the magnetic energy generates electricity according to Lenz’s law, the RFID tag will supply power, thereby activating the device.

## 2-4 Fun Projects

The previous projects are related to a single sensor. In the following part, we will combine various sensors to create some comprehensive experiments to perform special functions. There are multiple sensors in the kit so we just design a few classic combination experiments, which also illustrate basic logic of how most programs interact with reality.

### 2-4-01 Two Kinds of Transistors

---

**1. Overview**

This kit includes S8550(PNP) and S8050(NPN) transistors which look very similar, so we need to check their labels carefully. When a high level signal passes through the NPN, it is energized. But PNP requires a low level signal to enable it. Both are often used for contactless switches.

Let’s integrate the transistors with leds and buttons!

**3. Wiring Diagram 1**

**How to connect NPN(S8050) transistor in the circuit?**

**Schematic diagram 1:**

![Img](./media/img-20240903130912.png)

In the circuit, IO14 is at high level by default. When the button is pressed, it becomes low. 

We program the pin IO26 to output **HIGH**. After the current passing through the 1KΩ current-limiting resistor (to protect the transistor), **S8050(NPN) collector** is conducted so that the LED lights up.

**Wiring diagram 1:**

![Img](./media/img-20241127135204.png)

---

**4. Wiring Diagram 2**

**How to connect PNP(S8550) transistor in the circuit?**

**Schematic diagram 2:**

![Img](./media/img-20241125160915.png)

In the circuit, IO14 is at high level by default. When the button is pressed, it becomes low. 

We program the pin IO26 to output **LOW**. After the current passing through the 1KΩ current-limiting resistor (to protect the transistor), the S8550(PNP) is turned on, thus lighting up the LED.

The only difference between this circuit and the previous one is the connection of LED cathode. Here the LED cathode connects to **S8550(PNP) emitter** rather than **S8050(NPN) collector**.

**5. Code Flow**

The flow chart of the whole program is shown in the left. 

Flow chart is a method to express program ideas with intuitive graphics, which is easy to understand. Common flowchart symbols are shown in the right.

**6. Test Code**

Open “Thonny IDE” and choose “This Computer” → “D:” → “Codes” → “MicroPython_Code”. Open the file “2-4-01_Two_Kinds_of_Transistors.py” or copy and paste the following code into “Thonny IDE”.

```python

import machine

button = machine.Pin(14, machine.Pin.IN)   # Button
led = machine.Pin(26, machine.Pin.OUT)  # LED

# Start an infinite loop
while True:
    # Read the current value of the 'button' object (0 or 1) and store it in the 'button_status' variable
    button_status = button.value()
    # If the button is pressed (value is 0)
    if button_status == 0: 
        led.value(1) # Turn the LED on
    # If the button is not pressed (value is 1)
    else:
        led.value(0) # turn the LED off
```
---

**7. Test Result**

Two types of transistors can be controlled with the same code. When we press the button, the ESP32 main board will send a low level signal; When we release it, it sends a high signal.

Connect the ESP32 main board to your computer via Micro USB cable. Click ![Img](./media/img-20241226133629.png) to run the code. After uploading the code, 

- With the S8050 (NPN) circuit, press the button to light up the LED, indicating that it is in a high level on-state;

![Img](./media/img-20250117105923.png)

- With the S8550 (PNP) circuit, release the button to light up the LED, indicating that it is in a low level on-state.

**7. Code Explanation**

1\. flag, the original value of which is 0, is used as the criterion for judging if. When the if statement in the while is satisfied, flag=1, that is, x meets the condition of the if statement, and then the loop exits. If so, if-else statement will output the correct x. Otherwise, “x satisfies the condition of the if statement” is not found.

```python
def fun(button1):
    global flag
    if flag == 0:
      led_R.value(0)
      led_G.value(1)
      led_B.value(1)
      playtone(392)
      sleep(0.375)

      led_B.value(1)
      playtone(349)

    elif flag == 4:
      led_R.value(1)
      led_G.value(0)
      led_B.value(0)
      playtone(330)
      sleep(0.625)
    elif flag == 5:
      led_R.value(0)
      led_G.value(1)
      led_B.value(0)
      playtone(294)
      sleep(0.75)
    elif flag == 6:
      led_R.value(1)
      led_G.value(1)
      led_B.value(1)
      playtone(262)
      sleep(1)
    else:
      led_R.value(0)
      led_G.value(0)
      led_B.value(0)
      buzzer.duty_u16(0)
    if flag < 7:
      flag = flag + 1
    else:
      flag = 0 
```
2\. Configure the interrupt mode. 

**fun**: Interrupt the execution of a call-back function;

**trigger**: There are four ways to trigger the interrupt: Pin.IRQ_FALLING(falling edge), Pin.IRQ_RISING(rising edge), Pin.IRQ_LOW_LEVEL(low level), Pin.IRQ_HIGH_LEVEL(high level).

```python
button1.irq(fun,Pin.trigger)
```
The falling and rising edge are collectively called “triggered by edge”, whose process that is a pin value changing from 1 to 0 when the button is pressed. 

![Img](./media/img-20250102151501.png)

Therefore, we can choose to trigger the external interrupt by falling edge. When the button is pressed, the interrupt is immediately generated.

### 2-4-03 Electronic Hourglass

---

**1. Overview**

There is no electronic clock in ancient days, so hourglass is invented to measure time. The capacity of both sides of the hourglass is relatively large, and there is a small channel in the middle. When it is upright, the side with fine sand on the top will flow down through the channel to the other side due to gravity. After they are all down, invert it and record the number of inversion times during a day, so they can know the approximate time the next day with hourglass repeatedly flowing. 

In this project, we use the ESP32 board to control tilt switch and LED to simulate an hourglass.

### 2-4-05 Home Appliances

---

**1. Overview**

In daily life, we generally use 220V AC to drive electrical appliances and control them with switches. However, if the switch is directly connected to the 220V AC circuit, once leakage occurs and people will be in danger. 

Therefore, in this project, we specially designed this relay module with NO(normally open) and NC(normally closed) to control motor rotation.

---

**2. Component Knowledge**

**Relay:** Relay uses a low-power circuit to control a high-power one. It consists of an electromagnet(controlled by low-power circuit) and a contact(control high-power circuit). When the electromagnet is energized, it attracts the contact. Below is a diagram of a commonly used relay:

![Img](./media/img-20240904105302.png)

---

**Parameters**

- Operating voltage: DC 5V
- Current: 50 mA
- Max power: 0.25W
- Input signal: digital signal
- Shock current: less than 3 A
- Operating temperature: -10°C ~ +50°C
- Control signal: digital signal
- Dimensions: 47.6 x 23.8 x 19 mm
- Positioning hole size: diameter of 4.8 mm

---

**Working principle:**

![Img](./media/img-20241120140441.png)

A relay comes with one moving contact and two static contacts A and B.

When the K is opened, no current passes through the relay. At this time, the moving contact contacts with the static contact B, so the upper part of the circuit is on. B is called the normally closed contact (NC), that is, the coil is closed without power.

When the K is closed, the relay circuit generates magnetic force through the current. At this time, the moving contact contacts the static contact A, so the lower part of the circuit is  on. A is called normally open contact (NO), that is, the coil is disconnected without power.

The moving contact is also known as common contact(COM).

A relay, in simple terms, is a switch. VCC is the positive power supply, GND is the negative power supply, IN is signal input pin, COM is a common terminal, NC is normally closed, and NO is the normally opened.

![Img](./media/img-20241120132942.png)

This relay is compatible with a variety of MCU control boards, which can be called an “automatic switch” controlling large current by small current. It allows control board to drive 3A loads, such as LED lights, DC motors, micro water pumps, solenoid valves pluggable interfaces.

### 2-4-06 Dimming Light

---

**1. Overview**

We have learned how the potentiometer works in experiments of breathing LED and transistors. Herein, we use the potentiometer as a switch to control the LED brightness by reading the analog values. The potentiometer analog value ranges from 0 to 4095. The brightness of the LED is controlled by the PWM value, which ranges from 0 to 255.

### 2-4-09 Light Theremin

---

**1. Overview**

---

The theremin is an electronic music instrument controlled without any physical contact.

It consists of two antennas attached to a box with knobs (one for the pitch and one for the volume), oscillators, amplifiers, and a speaker. The two hands of Thereminist is detected to control the oscillator and volume so that to play different tones according to hands’ positions.

Although we cannot make a complete Theremin with ESP32, we can design a game similar to it with a photoresistor and a passive buzzer.

Calibrate the light intensity range by waving your hand over the photoresistor before the project. Connect the LED to the IO25 as an indicator during calibration. When the LED lights up, it indicates the start of calibration, and when the LED goes out, the calibration ends.

When you wave your hand in front of the photoresistor, its value changes to control the passive buzzer to play different tones. Each photoresistor value is mapped to a certain tone, so that the buzzer plays music when you wave your hands.

Connect the ESP32 main board to your computer via Micro USB cable. Click ![Img](./media/img-20241226133629.png) to run the code. After uploading the code, the LED lights up, giving us 5 seconds to calibrate the detection range of the photoresistor.

Calibration is a crucial step. It takes into account not only the variety of lighting conditions we may encounter when using equipment, such as varying light intensity at different times of day, but also the distance between our hand and the photoresistor, which determines the playable range of the instrument.

After calibration, the LED indicator is off. Now we can wave hands to play music.  This allows us to adjust the height of our hands during composition. It is such an interactive and enjoyable experience!

### 2-4-10 Fire-Fighting Robot

---

**1. Overview**

Do you know about fire-fighting robots? According to estimates by the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB), fire accidents in India have killed more than 1.2 million people from 2010 to 2014. Even though many precautions are taken, these disasters still happen from time to time. With the advancement of technology and the development of robot technology, it is very possible to use robots to replace firefighters in the future, which improves the efficiency of fire fighting and protects the lives of firefighters.

In this project, we will learn how to build a very simple robot with the ESP32 board. We detect the flame with the flame sensor and turn on the motor to blowout the fire source.

**6. Test Result**

**ATTENTION:** The fan requires a larger current than other sensors when it is rotating, thus voltage and current fluctuations may appear, especially when changing direction. This will greatly reduce the voltage and current of the main board, resulting in a reset. Thus, an external power supply is required.

Connect the ESP32 main board to your computer via Micro USB cable. Click ![Img](./media/img-20241226133629.png) to run the code. After uploading the code, “Shell” shows the ADC value of the flame sensor. If the value exceeds 2000, the fan will turn on to blowout the fire, with LED blinking. When the value is lower than 2000, the fan and LED turn off.

**7. Code Explanation**

In the code, we set the threshold to 2000(item > 2000), which can be modified according to the actual situations. When the flame sensor detects that the analog value reaches this threshold, the fan will automatically turn on; Otherwise it turns off. See [2-3-11](https://docs.keyestudio.com/projects/KS5020/en/latest/docs/2.%20MicroPython_Tutorial.html#small-fan) for how to drive the fan.

**6. Test Result**

Connect the ESP32 main board to your computer via Micro USB cable. Click ![Img](./media/img-20241226133629.png) to run the code. After uploading the code, cover the sensing area of the photoresistor and wave you hand in front of the PIR motion sensor, and you will see the LED lights up for a few seconds. Meanwhile, the “Shell” prints the lighting duration of the LED. If the PIR motion sensor detects a movement without covering photoresistor, the LED will not turn on.

### 2-4-13 Temperature and Humidity Meter

---

**1. Overview**

In winter, the humidity in the air is very low, that is, the air is very dry. Coupled with the cold, human skin is easy to be too dry and cracked, so you may need to a humidifier. But how to know the humidity? A humidity sensor. We have learned how the DHT11 temperature and humidity sensor works. In this project, we combine the sensor with the I2C 128×32 LCD display to make a temperature and humidity meter.

**7. Code Explanation**

1\. Define a common cathode 7-segment digital tube display code. `SEGCODE[]`: An array used to store an encoding of numbers 1 to 6 on a common cathode digital tube.

```python
SEGCODE = [0x3f, 0x06, 0x5b, 0x4f, 0x66, 0x6d, 0x7d, 0x07, 0x7f, 0x6f]
```
2\. Variable initialization.

- `si`, `rck`, `sck`: Pin and output modes of 74HC595. `tilt`: Connect the digital pin of tilt switch and set it to output mode.

```python
si = machine.Pin(5, machine.Pin.OUT)  # SI of 74HC595
rck = machine.Pin(23, machine.Pin.OUT)  # RCK of 74HC595
sck = machine.Pin(18, machine.Pin.OUT)  # SCK of 74HC595

tilt = machine.Pin(26, machine.Pin.IN) # Tilt pin
```
3\. The hc595_shift function shifts the data into the 74HC595 shift register.

```python
def hc595_shift(dat):
    # Set the RCLK pin to low
    rck.off()

    # Iterate through each bit (from 7 to 0)
    for bit in range(7, -1, -1):
        # Extract the current bit from the input data
        value = 1 & (dat >> bit)

        # Set the SRCLK pin to low
        sck.off()

        # Set the value of the SDI pin
        si.value(value)

        # Clock the current bit into the shift register by setting the SRCLK pin to high
        sck.on()

    # Latch the data into the storage register by setting the RCLK pin to high
    rck.on()
```

4\. Initialize `random seed` .

```python
random.seed(time.ticks_us())
```
5\. `tilt_callback()` switches the tilt state.

```python
def tilt_callback(pin):
    global tilt_state
    tilt_state = not tilt_state
```
6\. append `tilt_callback()` to the pull-down input status of tilt switch.

```python
tilt.irq(trigger=machine.Pin.IRQ_FALLING, handler=tilt_callback)
```
7\. Continuously display the current number. If the tilt switch does not vibrate, the numbers keep changing; If it vibrates and then stops, a specific number is displayed.

```python
while True: 

    # Display the current digit on the 7-segment display
    hc595_shift(SEGCODE[num])

    # If the tilt is shaked and tilt state is True
    if tilt_state:
        pass

    # If the tilt is shaked again and tilt state is False, generate a new random digit
    if not tilt_state:
        num = random.randint(1, 6)
        time.sleep_ms(100) # Adjust this value to control the display refresh rate
```

### 2-4-20 Guess Numbers

---

**1. Overview**

In the previous experiments, we learned to display numbers on a digital tube and to use an infrared receiver to reveal the key value corresponding to the received remote control. Herein, we will combine the IR receiver and the digital tube to display numbers.

There are keys (“①”, “②”, “③”, “④”, “⑤”, “⑥”, “⑦”, “⑧”, “⑨”, “0”) on the remote control. We press them to display corresponding numbers on the digital tube;Use the "*" key to control the display of a digit tube. And the “OK” is used to control the external LED to be on or off. So we first need to learn a data type — flag.

Data type flag is a numeric form with variable storing 8 bits (1 byte), and it can only be **True(1)** or **False(0)**. It displays its value as True or False (when using Print), or #TRUE# or #FALSE# (when using Write #). Therefore, we can use the keywords True and False to assign this variable to one of these two states.

We can program: When the “OK” key is pressed and a certain condition is met, light the external LED; When the “OK” key is pressed and another condition is met, turn off the external LED. Therefore, flag is a perfect choice because it can only be True or False. Now it is simple: We set the flag to true when pressing the “OK” key to light up external LED; Similarly, press the “OK” while the flag is false, and turn off the external LED.

### 2-4-21 Smart Access Control System

---

**1. Overview**

In life, many access control systems use RF modules for unlocking, which is both convenient and safe. We have learned the working principle of the RFID RC522 module and the servo. In this project, we will learn to use them to set up an access control system.

The principle is very simple. In the sensor area on the RFID RC522 module, we use IC card or key chain to unlock, the servo rotates to open the lock.

### 2-4-22 Astern Detector

---

**1. Overview**

Bats fly and acquire prey by echolocation. What is echolocation? Some animals emit ultrasonic waves from throat through the mouth or nasal cavity and determine directions by echo sounds. Inspired by bats, scientists invented radar. Radar antenna likes a bat’s mouth, and the radio waves emitted by the antenna are equivalent to a bat’s ultrasonic waves, and the fluorescent screen to receive the echo waves is a bat’s ear.

In this project, we combine the HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor, passive buzzer and OLED display to make a simple radar. The passive buzzer will play different tones and  the corresponding distance will also be displayed on the OLED.

### 2-4-23 Cooling Device

---

**1. Overview**

In life, our computers and circuit board chips will heat up seriously due to long working time or large power consumption, so we often need a cooling device.

We have learned how the LM35 temperature sensor, the OLED display, the 130 DC motor work. So in this project, we combine them to build a simple cooling device. When the LM35 temperature sensor detects that the ambient temperature is higher than a certain value, the 130 motor will turn on for cooling down, and then the temperature value will be displayed on the OLED.

**7. Code Explanation**

As we learned before, we set a temperature threshold (it can be modified according to the actual situation). The motor rotates when the detected value exceeds the threshold, and the OLED displays the temperature value. When the LM35 temperature sensor detects the ambient temperature is higher than a certain value, the motor is turned on for cooling down, and then the temperature value is revealed on the OLED.
